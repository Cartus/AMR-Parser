Establishing Models in Industrial Innovation
After its competitor invented the front loading washing machine , the CEO of the American IM company believed that each of its employees had the ability for innovation , and formulated strategic countermeasures for innovation in the industry .
1. Establish an innovation fund with a maximum amount of 1,000 U.S. dollars .
2. Choose 100 innovative concepts to encourage employees to conduct research and development during their work time or spare time .
3. From among them , pick out 50 for submission to an assessment committee to assess .
Since the Tangshan Earthquake , the starting point for construction standards in the mainland is that under an earthquake of the same magnitude , buildings should preserve their basic frame without collapsing .
However , most of the buildings in this hard - hit area did not meet these requirements , with the widespread collapse of school buildings in particular arousing intense public disgust .
Raising standards to in excess of Tangshan 's 8.0 magnitude could leave authorities with some breathing space for explanation , and alleviate public anger .
According to information leaked from numerous channels , we can say for certain that before the earthquake struck , the serious earthquake risk in the Ngawa region was already well known to the CCP .
Although current forecasting standards cannot give us an accurate prediction of the exact time , place , and strength of an earthquake , there is considerable experience accumulated both in China and overseas in predicting to within the timeframe of a month , and the area of a province .
In regions where the earthquake risk is high , warning the public and spreading disaster prevention awareness could greatly reduce casualties during earthquakes ; this is the very minimum duty that any responsible government should undertake .
In the past the CCP has done a lot of these sorts of things , but on this occasion not only did nothing , but in response to queries from the public pulled out some whopping lies , playing syntax games with words like " geological disaster " and " earthquake disaster " .
I think that if our Earthquake Administration had been able beforehand to do a simulation of big earthquakes on this Longmenshan mountain earthquake belt , then on that day of May 12 , once the Earthquake Administration had measured the quake at a magnitude of 7.8 , we would have been able to broadly judge the extent of damage and destruction in the earthquake disaster zone .
If the simulation program was well designed , circumstances like debris blocking roads , heavy rainfall obstructing parachute drops , power and communication outages should all have been within expectations .
Instead in this instance the Liberation Army headquarters emergency contingency plan obviously was not a contingency plan designed with earthquakes as the assumed condition , as the soldiers all rushed straight to Wenchuan , without immediately sending out troops in the direction of badly - hit areas Beichuan , Qingchuan and Gansu 's Longnan ; only 24 hours later was the full extent of the disaster area taken into consideration .
In addition , the breakdown in communication also brought a serious problem to the surface . In the past , Red Army regiments were able to maintain contact with central headquarters by relying on just one battered radio . On this occasion though , people had no way to deal with the communication failure .
It is clear that preparations prior to the event were not constructed on the basis of an earthquake disaster simulation .
While it should have been a disaster relief command that takes overall leadership , it has suddenly come face - to - face with the broad base of disaster victims , directly dealing with them .
The lack or serious shortage of intermediate layers of Party organizations and units between the two has resulted in its inability to consider major issues with endless minor issues on hand , such that even if it is highly capable , it wo n't last long , as it will be dragged down by numerous petty things .
This would have been unimaginable during the Great Tangshan Earthquake . A time without volunteers or mental workers , such petty things as directly dealing with average people were performed by the most primary Party branches , as well as enterprises and public institutions .
As soon as the earthquake occurred , grass - root organizations contacted their own people and average people also contacted their own systems or departments , in an interdependent manner .
Under the centralized leadership of higher - level organizations , everyone acted to make the rescue efforts very outstanding and successful , such that the Great Tangshan Earthquake , which happened just a few years ago , was forgotten all together in the subsequent reform and opening - up .
It is obvious that no social or political problems were left then , nor were sequelae that cause headaches to later generations .
During a time of prosperity and happiness , such a big earthquake suddenly struck .
Many people died , much property was destroyed , it was quite clearly a great disaster .
But it was not totally without benefits , and I believe that its greatest benefit was that it served to strip off the false benevolence that composed the outer skin of the elitists , the politicians , the capitalists , and exposed once and for all the rotten cannibalistic core within .
And an additional benefit was that many people who had been deluded came to their senses .
Temporarily laid aside these abstract things and avoided speaking at length , saying only a few details that left the elitists , the politicians and capitalists highly embarrassed .
The experts had just finished saying " Sacrificing yourself to help others is a foolish idea " , when the leaders had no choice but to call once again for selfless devotion .
This was mere chicanery , to the point where before engaging in life - saving , donation to charity , these sorts of behaviors , an idea had to be flashing through people 's minds :
Am I being foolish in doing this ?
And when people saw on CCTV those private firms manufacturing tents in Jiangsu and Zhejiang working overtime to produce more tents , the first idea that popped to mind I 'm afraid was probably " This time these capitalists have struck it big ! "
" Why is it that these capitalists instead of those capitalists get the big order forms , surely there could n't be anything fishy involved ?
During this process , there were again talks about filing a complaint against the Xinghui Travel Agency .
The reason for filing the complaint is that even if we owed their hourly fees , they still should fulfill their obligation on the contract they signed : driving people from Canberra back to Sydney .
As long as we stick to this issue , Xinghui surely has no way of winning the lawsuit if it goes to court .
However , what greatly surprised me was the attitude of the student union in this appeal . They seemed very reluctant to make the contract public .
They even lied , saying that they and Xinghui initially felt that signing a contract would rather make each other feel like strangers since they were both doing it for the sake of the motherland .
As you know , this type of logic absolutely wo n't work in Australia .
Xinghui accepted this order of ours and deployed all the buses of other travel agencies in Sydney .
Without the guarantee from the contract signed with us , they would surely have been unable to deploy them !
In addition , there was something else that was very suspicious .
I heard from a friend at the consulate that the government took this matter very seriously and had promptly agreed to allocate funds to compensate the students who had used their own money instead that night .
Yesterday afternoon I went back to check out the torch relay , but even the flame was practically impossible to see , let alone the guys carrying the torch .
There were so many people there it was frightening . Some had even climbed onto the roofs of buses !
I headed straight for the center of activities , but in actual fact traffic was being controlled as early as 4 o'clock , and they had already started limiting the crowds entering the sports center .
Some guys were really insane , banding together in groups and yelling out " Go China ! "
I actually had some other classmates there , and was going to call them .
I guessed the carrying capacity of the base station towers was totally overloaded , and I could n't get through at all . I was only able to find a signal , not a chance of connecting to the Internet .
Only one phone call I made there got through - that was calling home .
I had a look at my call register , and out of dozens of calls dialed only one was properly connected !
Sometime after 6 I went straight back home to watch it on TV . The spectacle was just as astonishing on TV , except that it was just one angle of the whole thing .
Next time I wo n't be partaking in this kind of activity !!
Wang Shi 's experience of being under public condemnation underscored to a certain extent the tense relationship between the rich and poor classes in Chinese society ;
because as China grows prosperous day by day , the gap of wealth between the successful elite and the remaining 1.3 billion people is widening .
Thirty years ago , people had basically the same incomes , which were all deplorably meager .
However , Hurun Report ( Hurun Report ) shows that by 2007 , there were a total of 106 billionaires ( in U.S. dollars ) in China , with the number of people only next to that of the United States .
Now , Wang Shi said , these responses have had effects on me .
He admitted that he was not sensitive enough to the current situation when he wrote his blog .
Wang Shi noted additionally that since China currently has not yet established a sound system of social security insurance , the growing hatred of the rich is unavoidable .
On Tuesday , Wanke announced that it would make an additional donation of RMB 100 million yuan for the temporary resettlement and post - disaster reconstruction in the next three to five years .
Yao Ming , the basketball player who was hailed as a national hero thanks to his success in establishing himself in NBA , was also blamed after he announced his donation of RMB two million yuan because a rumor on the Internet alleged he had donated one million U.S. dollars for disaster relief of Hurricane Katrina ( Hurricane ) in 2005 .
Even so , donation behavior and the treatment of donation behavior should not deviate from two principles , namely that it is voluntary and does not seek return . Otherwise , the donation loses its original meaning .
In actual fact , whether it is McDonalds or any other foreign owned enterprises in China on the so - called " international iron rooster " blacklist , they all gave generously to the cause of helping the disaster victims , exhibiting their social responsibility .
Even if by comparison some companies really did n't donate a huge amount , they should not be besieged or subjected to verbal violence in the arena of public opinion .
Donating , after all , is not a legal obligation that companies must carry out . Urging businesses to donate apart from the force of moral considerations should not take the form of any other coercive means .
As long as a company 's source of income is legal , any compulsory payment outside of legal obligations is a kind of theft .
Even in an abnormal circumstance such as disaster relief , legal order and the rights bestowed upon by law should be respected .
If we are unfortunate enough to be unable to avoid becoming a disaster victim , we can at least preserve the nobility and dignity of humanity and not turn into rabble .
The lawsuit proposed by Hai Ming did not have a clear subject of the right of action ; moreover it did not satisfy the legal requirement for libel .
For example , he failed to clarify whether Cafferty 's comment was an argument over opinions or an act of spreading an untruthful statement .
The malicious intent of Cafferty has not been established , either . More importantly , he has been unable to offer anything as to how to establish the damage to the 1.3 billion Chinese people .
In addition , in his complaint , it is said that Chinese people have already expressed their displeasure through demonstrations .
Here it is a country with the freedom of speech .
On the issue of libel , courts only support those who have actually suffered damages and have no other way to seek justice .
Therefore , it is very hard for the government , politicians , and public figures to get legal protection on the issue of libel ,
because they have the capability to clear themselves of " smears . "
If you have already cleared your own reputation through legal protests , for example , Chinese people are not goons and thugs , then a lawsuit is meaningless .
Remember , a lawsuit for libel is only to clear your name and get compensation .
After Lee Teng - hui put forth the " two states theory " , due to mainland countrymen being deceived by the CCP 's propaganda machine , many people advocated using force to unite Taiwan .
Because they have no understanding whatsoever of the situation in Taiwan and the will of the Taiwan people ,
they universally exhibited extreme nationalistic sentiment .
Just like the love - hate fusion of nationalistic war sentiment that erupted after the US mistakenly bombed the Chinese embassy .
They similarly did not understand the real story in Kosovo .
But Hong Kong people realize that first there was the Republic of China , only after that came " New China " ;
While this " Two States Separatist Theory " has purely and simply been dreamed up by the CCP .
Lee Teng - hui was doing nothing but bringing an already existing phenomenon to light .
Moreover , the grand old men of the CCP who handed over on a silver platter a huge chunk of land in Manchuria north of the Amur River to Soviet Russia , who gave away land equivalent to ten percent of national territory in northern Mongolia ; why not take this back , instead of insisting on trying to grab back a Taiwan that remains in the hands of Chinese people ?
However , even though Hong Kong people have their grumbles , the " two states theory " has in no way triggered a sentimental attachment in Hong Kong people for " Old China " .
I believe that our building industry here has not yet reached this level .
Not only has the law not yet reached this level , but the average person 's understanding has generally not reached this level .
Some officials , out of local economic considerations , by accident or design are frequently too lenient in dealing with property agents .
We all saw the damage wreaked by the Wenchuan Earthquake .
As to how much of this was a result of natural disaster , and how much was man - made calamity , a verdict will be drawn in the end .
Apparently , quality checks in the space industry are extremely rigorous , each part undergoes several inspection processes , every effort is made to ensure absolute safety .
But space ship accidents still happen from time to time .
Even such technologically advanced nations as the US have experienced several instances of space flight launch or return failures .
Since things can still go wrong even when they are subjected to incredibly rigorous inspections as in the space industry , then , with our current " dark " and corrupt property industry the way it is , people 's lives are even harder to place guarantees on .
Once a powerful earthquake strikes , the people 's lives really do become as tiny as those of ants .
It makes one tremble even without fear .
Following the Great Wenchuan Earthquake this time , there were compatriots who struggled out of the debris , wiped their tears and buried the bodies of their families , but they braced up again and declared to the world , " we are not beaten down ; we are on our feet again ; the earthquake cannot shake the staunch will of the Chinese people ; trials and tribulations serve only to revitalize a nation ! "
This enables us to see the fighting spirits of the dauntless Chinese nation give off a dazzling radiance among people in disaster - hit areas .
The fact that these words are spoken by compatriots who have been through the disaster has given us , who could n't help our tears at the sight of their mishaps , so much comfort and encouragement . It gives us a hint that no force can beat down the Chinese people .
However , the words later reappeared somewhere else and from someone unusual , which I thought about for a few days . I feel , for some unknown reason , it is somewhat scary !
I just want to say , let there be no more disasters , so that China is safe and sound from now on and disasters are far away from China .
I pray to the God to open his eyes and do n't let disasters visit the Chinese land again !
We do n't want to revitalize the nation through trials and tribulations ,
but rather we want to revitalize the nation by passing our days safe and sound !
One important reason that a great number of people buried or trapped in debris in the Wenchuan earthquake - hit area were saved is that they were full of hopes and firmly believed the PLA would come to their rescue !
To settle victims , thousands of tents that stretched miles were soon set up , which contained public toilets , shops , and primary schools and middle schools .
Tens of thousands or even millions of those displaced by the disaster have gradually had a home to shelter from the wind and rain !
If everything were put in the market , such that all the land was sold to syndicates or farm owners , then where should the government set up tents ?
Do they expropriate the land on the spot ?
Even the government cannot override the market !
Supporting the disaster - hit areas has tested our competence , while the government 's ability to rule also stood the trial !
At critical moments , the ruling foundation --- workers and farmers , showed staunch support to the government !
If everything were put in the market , such that workers and farmers would have their fates controlled by the market and no longer count on or rely on the government by walking onto a path of the so - called " finding the market rather than the mayor ( government ) , " then what power would the government have ?
The post - catastrophe hyperinflation as expected by foreigners has not come either !
The government has human and financial capital under control , as well as energy and resources !
For example , the value of " seizing the pleasure of the moment " also has a long history .
" Sing a song when thou have wine , seize the day since life is short . " Some people in contemporary times think we should " satisfy and die . "
Some people have gone so far on the road that they " do n't know how to eat or play , "
and other take nude pictures and flaunt them online .
For another example , the pursuit of office titles and levels can also be traced back to the old days .
In ancient times there was Zhou Li to distinguish the order of hierarchy and nobility , constructing a pyramid - like social organizational structure .
The son of the Heaven wore different clothes than others . The color of a door and the number of caldrons used for meals were all symbols to distinguish the hierarchy and nobility of people .
The aim was to settle disputes , stop fights and stabilize the society .
However , simultaneously it has also established a system that values life according to office levels , which to the contrary triggered contentions and destabilized the society .
Yet no matter how many changes of dynasties there are , the value system has always been carried on .
Higher or lower ranks in Qing Dynasty were distinguished by bird and animal patterns on clothes , Taiping Heavenly Kingdom used the size and color of a sedan chair as the symbol to distinguish between different ranks , and modern people use the motor vehicle displacement as a symbol to distinguish between different positions , all of which can be traced to the same origin .
I do n't care how much Wang Shi wastes every time he climbs a mountain , but I do strongly despise how he talks and the way he acts during this whole thing .
After donating , he suggested that charity should not be the burden of businesses , and therefore stipulated that his company 's employee donations should not exceed 10 yuan .
Totally absurd logic . Wang Shi 's reasoning is that making donations to charities then the burden of businesses could cause companies to fail in market competition ;
But we can see such philanthropists as Bill Gates , Li Ka - shing , Jackie Chan have not affected the growth of their enterprises in any way . Instead , they have actually increased the competitiveness of their companies .
And there were some netizens who hit back in the Wang Shi donations issue by admonishing us for forcing donations on moral grounds .
Exactly ! An excellent justification !
If you say that netizens rebuking Wang Shi is forcing donations , then what kind of behavior is Wang Shi preventing employees from donating more than 10 yuan ?
Wang Shi is the economic version of a cold - blooded animal , and we do n't care ,
but how come Wang Shi , how come he wants to restrict what employees do or do n't do on moral grounds ?
This really is a case of one rule for some , another rule for everyone else !!!
We see , as at May 17 , the Chinese government has accepted up to 6 billion in disaster - relief donations domestically and internationally , of which 4.8 billion is from domestic donors .
What we can see now are merely the name and figure of each donor constantly listed in what is like an honor roll .
Yet unfortunately , we do n't have more detailed information of the whereabouts and specific uses of the donated funds .
As corruption has long been prevalent among local governments and economic auditing is not transparent enough , disaster - relief funds are often appropriated , exhausted , expropriated and embezzled .
Therefore , once such a huge amount of disaster - relief funds from people the world and China are embezzled or otherwise partially transferred by local officials , the resulting political damage and lowering of the government 's image domestically and internationally will completely negate the positive image brought by the government 's disaster - relief efforts .
If the donations are directly put in the hands of disaster - hit people , it would push local prices higher , driving the already high inflation to a direction that is even harder to regulate .
It is said that our country 's earthquake forecasting is at an advanced level in the world .
But the glory of the earthquake workers did not produce good luck for the departed spirits of Wenchuan .
So , we again hear expert figures emphasizing once again , " Earthquake forecasts are a global challenge that so far no one has been able to solve . "
Consequently , we come to realize that the academic laurels for " the success rates of predictions of impending earthquakes that have already reached almost 40 % " are just conditions and capital used to apply for funding , evaluate professional titles and seek remuneration , rather than a hard rationale used to reduce bloodshed and deaths .
We should offer earthquake workers our full understanding .
Facing the caprice of nature , humankind is really insignificant .
Furthermore , although our sense of security increases with each passing day in line with " significant advances achieved " in seismology , we cannot look to anyone to give us any promises .
Because , once someone has made a promise , he would be doomed thereafter to bear this bloody weight of " being unable to effectively avoid earthquake disasters . "
And by not issuing any promises , he could actually avoid being censured .
Because " there is no way to make predictions " !
Humans can manufacture tanks that are much more powerful than ants , but humans cannot manufacture a living ant ...
However advanced instruments manufactured by humans are , their level of complexity cannot compare with a section of a toad 's nerve .
Do not regard earthquake prediction as a " practical skill " ; rather regard it as academic work in a study .
Take no notice of the real results in terms of preventing earthquakes or minimizing disasters ; rather singlemindedly pursue the scientific research level embodied in " prediction success rates . "
In the course of major disaster warnings , too many disputes relating to powers and interests are entangled .
The directions of research into earthquake prevention and disaster minimization are just confined to research into the phenomenon of earthquakes , but efforts to intervene in urban construction , to formulate and supervise building standards , and perfect and improve disaster rescue mechanisms and other aspects have been neglected .... .
We have also become blindly abreast of foreign countries even in earthquake research : we do n't believe in living beings raised as part of nature ; we just believe in the instruments we ourselves manufacture .
We do n't believe the warnings sent out by nature ; we just believe the warnings emitted by instruments in laboratories .
We do n't believe in what is seen and heard with their own eyes by millions of ordinary people ; we just believe in the authoritative conclusions of experts and scholars .
Chinese seismology is galloping down the wrong road .
Real estate is only one part of the national economy but the real estate phenomenon exists in every sector of the national economy .
The swift large - scale failure and bankruptcy of collective enterprises and state - owned enterprises is proof of this .
Things have reached the step where the national television station has to set up a stage with the country 's military singers , high - class singers , as well as top - of - the - line celebrities from all walks of life singing to folks like Wang Shi for donations .
We should n't be too bothered if folks like Wang Shi say something unpleasant .
A defeated general ca n't claim to be brave .
In front of folks like Wang Shi , the State Council are all defeated generals .
Because the missing - in - action army who built New China have been beaten to a pulp by folks like Wang Shi ; even if China has no earthquakes , there will be floods , as well as SARS , snowstorms , big freezes etc.
China is a land of many catastrophes - this has always been true and always will be .
Relying on singing for donations , entertaining for one 's supper , will not solve the problem .
And time and time again asking the national television station to get out there and carry the national flag , carrying on like this in the name of the country is outrageous , it 's the State Council 's problem .
All the people with one mind " as the national anthem is inspired by the foresight of " always being prepared " , designed for " advance , advance , advance , enter ! " instead of being designed for repeated begging , pleading for donations , and fund - raising .
From leaders to the common people , everyone needs to keep that in mind .
When we go back to the 10th Century AD , we find that the 10th Century AD gave birth to the first entrepreneurs .
Because the 10th Century AD was the very time when limited liability companies were established ; the Catholic Pope of the time had such a conviction during the 9th Century .
Are you afraid of going to Hell when you die ?
Yes , you are afraid - how could you not go just because you are afraid ?
Donate your property to the Church , show your loyalty to God and you wo n't go to Hell ,
so a lot of rich people donated their money to the Church before they died .
By the 10th Century AD , 60 % of Britain 's territory belonged to the Church ,
but their clergymen could n't manage it , and were unable to pass it on to the next generation . What could they do ?
So they set up the modern limited liability company .
How did they set it up ?
They hired professional managers to run these Church enterprises ,
these professional managers were the administrators ,
And who were the proprietors of these companies ?
The Church .
So what did this confirm ?
The first step in separating the administration rights from ownership ,
in no way because this was a great system , but rather that this was inevitable within the Church enterprises .
When forecasting earthquakes , why did it happen that only a few cases were successful while most cases were failures ?
According to this writer 's many years of research on precursory signs , the existence of precursory signs and earthquake predictions are two issues that are both connected and mutual differentiated .
The appearance of a precursory sign does n't mean it can accurately forecast the three elements of an earthquake , because precursory signs are extremely complicated .
There are certain differences in the categories , breadths , distribution ranges , and duration of precursory signs of different types of earthquakes in different places .
In " Regional Nature of Precursory Signs of Earthquakes , " this writer divides earthquakes into two major types according to the overall characteristics of pre - earthquake signs : strike - type and slip - type earthquakes .
The former occurs in areas where internal fault blocks or fault lines converge but not intersect , while the latter occurs in active fault lines .
Strike - type earthquakes have various types of precursory signs , which are widespread , long - lasting , and quite variable .
Slip - type earthquakes have fewer types of precursory signs , which have a smaller distribution range , shorter duration period , and smaller range of change .
In Chengdu , which is over 100 kms away from the epicenter , the earthquake should not have an intensity of over 7 , or 8 at the most .
There should not be any safety problems for Class A buildings like those at the airport , hospitals and schools that are designed to withstand a intensity of 8 .
So most buildings in Chengdu should still be able to use after emergency assessment , and citizens may go home reassured .
If not so , an investigation should be conducted for any jerry - built projects .
If large sums of money have been spent to provide protection , yet it fails to work when the earthquake comes ,
such that nobody dares to live at home , is able to use hospitals , or accesses airports , then has the money been thrown for nothing ?
Probably some would say the national building criteria for earthquake resistance was enacted in recent years , and older buildings may not comply with the requirements .
However , at the same time the government enacted the earthquake resistance criteria , it required all existing buildings which did not satisfy the criteria to be reinforced and removed of dangers in a timely fashion .
Thus one cannot shirk responsibilities on excuse that it is an old building .
In addition , the government also has criteria for earthquake resistance and prevention for rural buildings .
The earthquake in Sichuan stuns everyone .
Elementary school buildings collapsed , and children were buried in the rubble .
Middle school buildings collapsed , and young students were buried under the crumbled walls .
Kindergarten buildings also collapsed , and little children 's frail bodies fell helplessly next to the crumbled walls where they closed their innocent eyes forever .
We could n't help crying at this sorrowful scene .
Children are the flowers of our motherland and future of our motherland .
These flowers of life died early in a natural disaster .
Natural disasters cannot be predicted , but the school buildings should not have collapsed .
Why are the buildings behind the school buildings still there while the school buildings where children studied collapsed from the first floor to the fourth floor leaving only crumbled walls ?
Children , you should n't have departed like this .
Every year , all levels of People 's Congress are held from local governments to the Central Government .
Deputies to the People 's Congress , please make an all - around inspection of school buildings in all areas and inspect whether or not the school buildings in your constituencies are up to local earthquake - resistance standards , and then quickly make a proposal according to the existing problems and push each level of the government to complete rectifications and improvements within a limited time .
Special legislation in the National People 's Congress on construction of school buildings should be proposed .
There needs to be special legal procedures for the design , materials , construction , completion , and inspection of the school buildings to ensure that top priority be given to quality and durability .
Allowing all children to study safely is the sacred and bounden duty of the People 's Congress .
In June 1976 , 83 year - old Mao Zedong had already been revived once after suffering a myocardial infarction .
To get effective care for his condition , the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CCP established a special treatment team , in charge of his medical treatment and care .
The Political Bureau also specifically assigned people to the task of Mao Zedong 's medical care , taking turns with the doctors and nurses to be on constant vigil at his living quarters .
On the day of the Tangshan Earthquake , i.e. July 28th , those on duty at Mao Zedong 's quarters were Wang Dongxing , Wang Hongwen , and Mao Zedong 's confidential secretary , Zhang Yufeng .
In the early hours of the morning , with the clock hands pointing to 3:42 , the ground of Zhongnanhai suddenly started to shudder .
In Mao Zedong 's residence , the glass window in the foyer door rattled uncontrollably , and there was a huge bang from below like a tractor starting up , with Mao Zedong 's sickbed shaking non - stop .......
While Mao Zedong was convalescing , the employees and medical staff around him were all in a state of high tension , maintaining extremely silent surroundings and atmosphere .
In normal times , apart from the talking and noise of medical instruments when the doctors revived him , not a whisper could be heard .
After the nineties , state - owned engineering enterprises stopped recruiting construction workers .
But that is n't to say they stopped hiring people , but those they took in were all graduates with professional diplomas from polytechnic schools , technical colleges , and universities ; these staff all went into management .
During the early nineties , the formal employees of this enterprise still had complete working teams , such as bricklaying teams , woodwork teams , steel reinforcement teams , and machinery maintenance teams , but since they could not cope with a large volume of project tasks , they were already cooperating with some migrant worker units , in other words the familiar " contracting gangs " .
A collision occurred between tradition and reality .
Due to formal working units no longer taking on young employees , working units got increasingly older and broken up .
Some staff ( extremely few ) entered management .
A few exceptional former team leaders gradually became project managers .
Others became materials officers , safety officers and quality control officers , etc.
Those without connections became staff monitoring the construction site ------ similar to the security guards of today .
The workers no longer formed complete operating teams .
And at this time , migrant worker units gained an opportunity to develop .
The entire on - site operation work was all carried out by contracting gangs .
Working units disbanded .
The status of these workers was also changing .
The corrupt mentality that treating dinner and gift - giving is necessary for getting things done is deeply rooted in the minds of people from all walks of society .
In each case of corruption , those power - wielding bureaucrats , those scholars or technicians who have cornered the market in their fields , those capitalists with vast wealth , they are the ruling force of this society , and also the ones who profit from the corruption .
The powerless , pennyless working public with no access to information technology resources % PW are the ones who lose out from the corruption .
Today 's society is corrupt in every direction , and the direct cause is the reinstatement of private ownership and the scrapping of the public supervision of the Mao Zedong era .
In privatized societies , everybody tramples over others trying to maximize their own interests .
Doctors who do n't receive ' red envelopes ' have no motivation to properly cure the patient .
Teachers openly ask students to give them gifts ,
gang ringleaders use cash to have the media make them out as heroes ,
capitalists trying to annex state - owned property team up with scholars and academically demonstrate state - owned monopolies to be the reason behind corruption , and then reap in the profits .
Frequently the public , under the guidance of the mainstream media , only concern themselves with administrative and judicial corruption ; this in itself is a type of corruption .
Do commodity prices have a base value worth talking about ?
Do commodities have a true value ?
These are already elements of uncertainty .
With things , less is more ; sell as much as you want , as long as somebody will buy .
In fact , in a socialist country one cannot act in that way .
In the area of profiting from commodities , there have been no systems in place and no legal provisions ever since the reforms , there is no last word on how many multiples of cost profits are allowed to be , or what percentage .
China 's self - sufficient , natural economy was not without any advantages . At least it did n't try to reap large profits off its own people ,
now the exact opposite is the case .
A home appliance - whether you are Chinese or a foreigner , which regional category you fit in , whether you are a big city or a small city , whether you are a worker or a peasant - is always the same price .
Not knowing how much profit is in there , not caring who can afford it and who ca n't , these do not seem to be the principles of socialism .
And with farmers ' grain and rural products , if the country does n't wipe out agricultural taxes and does n't offer any subsidies , keeping on producing is a problem .
In order to improve the people 's living standards , the government set things so that grain is always the same price whether sold to big cities or to rich people .
With this kind of ratio in existence , in struggling areas trying for a comfortable life is very difficult .
This issue should attract the close attention of economists .
December 26 , 1975 , Mao Zedong had his 82th birth day , his last one .
Upon turning 80 , Mao Zedong felt apparently that he was old and would die soon .
Therefore , around his birthday those few years , Mao Zedong had always talked about life and death from time to time .
One thing he often said was : " 73 and 84 are ages at which you will be gone even if the King of Hell does n't call you . "
Also since he turned 80 , people had been paying more and more attention to Mao Zedong 's birthday .
Within the country , people dared not celebrate his birthday publicly , so they would celebrate quietly at home .
Local governments dared not present gifts to Mao Zedong , but would convey their blessings to Mao Zedong in various ways .
In the years before Mao Zedong passed away , his hometown Hunan would specially send things like long life noodles on December 26 every year .
For this , Mao Zedong had accepted with pleasure , which was quite unusual .
Despite Microsoft 's status as the globe 's most financially endowed high - tech leader , bargaining with Microsoft is something that is sure to leave you greatly disillusioned .
Microsoft 's dictionary has never contained the word " generous " .
So when the Jerry Yangs hope that by bargaining they can bump up Microsoft 's purchase price , they are being very unrealistic .
Microsoft raising its price ever so slightly already represented a big concession , proving that it really does want to get its hands on Yahoo ! .
Ultimately choosing to give it up was obviously a very painful decision for Microsoft .
Right from the start , this was a super acquisition that lacked bite ; despite the numbers being huge , even if the acquisition was successful , truly revolutionizing the framework of the Internet was simply not possible .
However , when the acquisition did fall through , it was also quite disappointing .
To us global observers watching the bustling scene , giving up the acquisition was like a play stopped abruptly halfway through , without ever getting the chance to watch the rest of the fun , and indeed there was no shortage of theatrical transformations .
We have no choice but to return back to our mundane lives , and wait for this increasingly passion - destroying industry to come up with the next affair of note .
Since last September , when his daughter was diagnosed with symptoms such as bloody feces and kidney stones , Zhou Jin has been in succession to Yongzhou in Hunan , Hebei , Xiamen , Beijing , Guangzhou , and more to take his daughter to hospitals for treatment , but the child 's illness has continued to improve and decline .
This September , Zhou Jin , working in Shenzhen , took his daughter to the Shenzhen Children 's Hospital for examination and treatment .
The results of the examination are that the upper rectum was severely infected and the right kidney expanded . The kidney stone found in previous hospital treatments was not found this time .
Zhou Jin said that his daughter , a little over two years old this year , had eaten Sanlu milk powder for over a year . Last September after the bloody feces appeared , family members took his daughter to the Yongzhou hospital for examination . The doctors informed them that " there is no better treatment method , just have her drink more water . "
Worrying about his daughter 's illness , Zhou Jin asked the county hospital to issue a certificate to transfer her to another hospital , to let his daughter go to a better hospital for treatment .
The hospital Medical Administration Department told Zhou Jin that issuing of the certificate to transfer to another hospital would require the approval of the Ministry of Health , and more than one month would be needed .
" I went repeatedly to find the relevant health department , but they passed my case back and forth . I was helpless and could only take my daughter to the place where I work -- Xiamen , to carry out treatment . "
Have to suffer this pain .
The doctor in charge told us that the kid would be out of danger if he could just urinate .
Getting him to urinate could n't be more difficult !
This urine is more valuable than gold .
He did n't pee at all during the first two or three days in hospital .
We were all desperate at that time .
The hospital already arranged for him to undergo dialysis surgery .
And my satisfying son finally urinated .
Out of danger at last , but one trouble passed and another one took its place , there came an acute diarrhea and fever , he was stooling several dozen times every day , you can imagine the suffering .
He had just danced a circle around the Grim Reaper , and encounted this problem on top of that . I was really worried he would n't pull through .
I do n't know what was happening with the injection treatment at the hospital - the more they injected him the worse the diarrhea , nothing would stop it .
After a few more days of treatment , the kid 's diarrhea was a little better and the doctors got him to do an ultrasound .
The kidney stone had been washed out by the medicine . There were no more stones on his kidneys .
The hospitalization was very expensive and our family could n't afford it , so we had no choice but to leave the hospital and go home .
On the night of Dragon Boat Festival he passed out a stone by himself , it was a sedimentary one .
The whole family was really excited , we all thought he was better , that he was cured .
Over 200 Han pupils in 15th primary school in Urumqi were injected , * and there were actually Uyghur students from the same schools involved * , it was shocking !
On the day of September 1st alone , at the entrance of " Longyuan Supermarket " on Urumqi 's Friendship Road , two people were injected and sent to hospital .
On the same day , in Shuimogou District , No. 106 Bus had just pulled up at the Gaojiazhuang stop when several people were injected , soon , the Uyghur assailants jumped from the bus and fled , but they were soon detained after bystanders gave chase .
The 920 and many other buses also experienced a number of poisoned syringe cases .
On August 31 , the No. 17 bus exploded near Xibei Road , while the No. 14 bus was bombed at the same time .
Nevertheless , all news was blocked .
But witnesses shortly after spread the news to the outside world by telephone - Urumqi security is extremely deteriorating !
Even more ironic was in late August , when * President Hu Jintao * had just visited Xinjiang on an inspection tour . Upon his return to Beijing , the situation in Urumqi was far from settling , instead the * Uyghur terrorists * becoming even more rampant , and the numbers of attacks and bombings were increasing rather than decreasing !
The incompetence of the Xinjiang government would make the Central extremely troublesome !
Listening to Yesterday Once More by the Carpenters , seeing the photograph album in which photos showing collages of compatriots receiving awards , I do n't know when people should cry , and my heart is lost .
After so many years can they still sing Yesterday Once More ?
Dear friends , let me fill in some of the words for the melody right now in my heart .
Do n't worry , the cold - blood is n't me , it 's a part of my heart .
If an Olympic Games were held taking the damage done to mankind by industrial pollution as theme , I think our dear motherland should be able to win a gold medal and a champion of winning the grand total in gold medals . I just do n't know how the opening ceremony would be run , how volunteers should be recruited , or which song should be sung lustily .
The title of the sick man of East Asia once went far away following the revolutionary course brimming with victories , but after seeing this group of photos , I feel that they have whistled back with this brand new attitude of faster , higher , stronger .
What is different is that I dare not expect for ; in what way can we have again " The Destruction of Opium at Humen " with " upholding the country 's interests with one 's life " .
Because we and our motherland cannot depart from this shocking pollution . What we can do is just to improve , adjust and vaguely hope .
The people who have been sacrificed have , without choice , used their lives to pave the road to success for another group of people .
At that time , tens of thousands of city youth headed to the countryside , but by no means were all of them were true believers .
Some were under pressure to show their " revolutionary zeal " , others went because there were no jobs in the city .
The poverty and backwardness of the countryside were appalling , and most of the educated youth became disillusioned .
In the middle of the 1970 's the intensity of the Cultural Revolution waned , and one after one the youths returned to the cities or went to study in university , but back then there was n't an exam to get into university , it depended on your political background and behavior .
Jianguo was not one of these . He worked for seven years in a rural part of Inner Mongolia , became a village head , and was very popular with the locals .
He was a dab hand at working the fields , and could match the locals when it came to drinking spirits .
He married an old school friend of his from Beijing , and she stayed behind for him , the two living their own little lives together in the country .
Although the villagers had no interest in the various kinds of " revolutionary practices " that Jianguo tried to make them adopt , he was honest and kind , and his generous personality won their friendship and affection .
After Jianguo had returned to Beijing for not even a few moths , the student movement in Tiananmen began .
Jianguo went to the square to listen to speeches and singing , and watched a new generation of students be rebellious , and was shaken and moved .
Twenty years before , the god of the " Red Guards " was Mao , but the ideal of young people now was wearing jeans and a T - shirt , and a new statue had been erected : Lady Liberty .
At that time I lived in Beijing , and every day went to the square . When we ran into each other , Jianguo did n't say much . However it looked like he had a million thoughts stirring in his heart .
One afternoon , I went to see an active figure in the square , and arranged to go together with him .
Friends greeted me with smiles , and asked me to go into their tent , as a meeting of student leaders was going on inside .
Jianguo was just behind me and had just started to come inside , when my friends frowned and stopped him : " No , you ca n't come inside ! "
I explained , saying this was my brother . My friends listened with surprise .
Beijing - born and Beijing - raised Jianguo , he looked today completely like a villager from the countryside .
Wang Peirong thinks that this is related to blockages in the usual reporting channels .
He pointed out , all of his reports were made under the circumstances that the normal reports did n't work , and he had no choice but made reports online .
A typical example is that the fall of Dong Feng , the most debaucherous secretary labeled as one - husband - with - two - wife in the country .
Wang Peirong thinks that Dong Feng 's absurdity and corruption was actually an open secret , but nobody investigated and penalized ; and even though Wang Peirong reported on this using his real name to the concerned departments for one year , no one bothered to inquire about it .
Wang Peirong also thinks that reporting online is equivalent to publicizing the corruptive deeds of the person being reported against . Once under the public eye , the possibility of any blatant cover - ups becomes greatly reduced , thus , making it easier to investigate and penalize .
Many people will ask , Chargeback Rival is made by an individual , so what is the relationship with 360 ?
There are likely three original reasons why 360 uses a person 's name to issue Chargeback Rival :
General manager Zhou has done too much bad stuff on PC 's , and did n't want to offend too many people on cell phones , so he found an individual author to act as a scapegoat ( if a cell phone SP company knew that it was 360 that block their way . Each one of them is tough . ) ;
Using an individual author to issue it , it was easy to defraud the grassroots netizens of their sense of identification and sympathy .
If you see I am an individual netizen , who has been charged money , so makes a piece of software in order to help everyone solve this problem , then how moved it seems from the outside .
Using an individual author to issue , there has been a strong power of captivation . Many companies in the SP and wireless realm would definitely think that a product from an individual author would not have much influence , so would not pay too much attention to it .
Nevertheless , 360 already did this under cover of promoting Chargeback Rival in large scale . Once after Chargeback Rival became dominant on the situation , then it is to be transformed into 360 .
Having seen no hope from Xu Ming , Wang Peirong then could only post the relevant problems online .
Not only that , Wang Peirong 's generous and courageous endeavors have led to revenge from the reported on numerous occasions : when reporting the corruption of Li Rongqi , he was severely beaten up by hired goons ; when reporting the black forces , he was retaliated by the black forces , and hospitalized for the injuries .
But these have not been able to halt the momentum of Wang Peirong 's reporting .
However , in the program , Wang Peirong calls out to the parties and the government to set out policies and provisions to protect the personal safety and legal rights of whistle blowers .
This program of << News Night Banquet >> on Jiangsu TV 's city channel , caused a great uproar in the community .
But in contrast with this , Wang Peirong , well reputed as Jiangsu 's " number one person in online anti - corruption " , is now suffering unfair treatment .
Because of pressure from the reported officials such as Li Rongqi , China 's University of Mining and Technology has suspended Wang Peirong 's teaching duties .
How China University of Mining and Technology responds to Jiangsu mainstream media 's positive and active appraisal of Wang Peirong ; how well they treat Wang Peirong ; and how they protect Wang Peirong 's legal rights , are unavoidable questions placed in front of the Mining University 's decision makers .
The Chinese defense budget for 2012 is RMB 670.274 billion , increasing by RMB 67.604 billion and 11.2 % compared to the previous year 's estimated budgetary expenditure .
The Chinese military expenditures are increasing too fast for America , and the increase is currently over RMB 100 billion , but what on earth can China do with this additional amount of more than RMB 100 billion dollars ?
Based on the current exchange rate between the Renminbi and US dollar , it amounts to more than US$ 10 billion , which can purchase more than a hundred of the latest 3.5 generation Western fighter planes .
If it is used to manufacture Chinese J - 10 fighters , over two hundred planes can be produced , or perhaps even more . In one go , China can improve its prowess in the air by a margin even greater than the total sum of a mid - sized Western country .
In fact , what America really fears is not the increase of military expenditure , but rather the rapid rate at which China is upgrading its military technologies , which may enable China to overtake America soon .
Compared to America , China has many inadequacies , for instance , its high technology development is not as mature as America 's , and its basic infrastructure , the standard of education of its citizens , development of its systems and so on are also lacking . However , China has its own natural advantages , and that is China possesses a long history and stability of culture .
Some people pointed out in their comments that this is a serious disadvantage to China when compared to America , as they say that China is carrying too heavy a burden which will hinder rapid development ,
in fact , this reasoning is extremely incorrect , the Chinese culture is profound , so whatever problems the country may face , it can draw on its historic experiences ,
for instance , when China deals with international affairs , it can learn from how the Yuan Dynasty handled foreign trade and the problems of co - existence between multiple ethnic groups , or it could at least draw a lesson from the negative experiences .
Currently America is drastically cutting down on its military expenditure , however it fears that China will substantially increase its military expenditure . America is desperately attempting to return to the Pacific Ocean as it wishes to continue to contain the growth of Chinese military strength ,
America controls the Straits of Malacca , and a large majority of China 's shipping vessels are under its control . However if America wishes to maintain the development of world trade order , its expenses will naturally be enormous .
If it were not for the financial crisis , a number of Western countries have stated that they would not have considered budgetary issues for American military deployments .
As a matter of fact , neighboring countries need not be too sensitive to the sharp increase in Chinese military spending . They fear that China will pose a direct threat to them , but Chinese history has shown that China has never had the habit of wielding its military might to challenge Western countries , but as for how they habitually view China will depend on the profound influence of the Chinese culture .
China does not like to show off , preferring to restrain itself , and the same is true in the field of military matters .
Up to now , China revealed that it has three models of the 4th generation stealth fighter planes under research and development , and the J 20 is expected to enter mass production and service next year , which is a direct blow to America ,
however , what is even more terrifying for America is that this Chinese fighter plane model has already displayed surprisingly advanced performance during combat , and it is feared that its level of technological advancement cannot be matched by the F 22. After all , this model of fighter plane has never participated in actual inspections up to this point .
Perhaps this is understandable for China , but it is inevitable that the 4th generation Chinese fighter plane would create a stir .
The original order has been disrupted . After all , the Chinese fighter is no less powerful than the American one .
According to American media reports , China 's military expenditures are expected to reach US$ 200 billion in two years ' time ,
Of course there is a strong possibility that this number has been greatly exaggerated , and it is also embellished by the China Threat theory . However , such moves by America no longer has much effect on China , even if the Chinese defense expenditures reach US$ 200 billion , America cannot do anything to China ,
Recently , China adopted an aggressive stance , casting negative votes on the Syria issue three times , and in relation to Japan 's naming of the Diaoyu Islands , Beijing appears to be sending a message that ' we have accumulated sufficient power , and we are not afraid of your distortions of the truth . '
The Chinese military expenditures are soaring . By contrast , America is continuously cutting down on its military expenditures , repeatedly asserting that its prowess will be replaced by small but elite troops that will not affect its capabilities . As it is nothing more than self - consolation , therefore , it caused widespread concern throughout America .
Certainly , this is clearly a refurbished version of the ' military threat theory ' from America , and it is now changed to a ' threat by military expenditure theory ' , however , China is used to finger - wagging and criticism from America , and as China grows increasingly confident , this writer believes that America will terminate its friendly economic relations with China soon or later ,
China 's soaring military expenditures imply that China is reluctant to be limited to a position as the world 's No. 2 , and nor is it content to be world No. 1 in name only . Instead , it intends to recover its historical 1,500 - year glory as the leader of the world .
The content is not quite the same as the title ...
Let me whisper this : Doing business in America depends on connections , and red packets are also accepted ~ same as in China ... 
Faced with rascals and hooligans like the Americans , the Chinese have no choice but to arm themselves .
Indeed . I wonder what our military expenditure is like in proportion to America 's , and besides how much of our military expenditure is genuinely spent on sophisticated national defenses , if it is really spent on advanced defenses , there will never be such a thing as too much ! Compared to America we are still lagging far behind !
Now that Vice President Xi has visited America , the direction for the Sino - American relationship has become the focus of world attention .
But no matter how sweetly imperialist America talks , I have no hope for imperialist America .
Imperialist America has always been a country failing to live up to its words , and as long as something is in its interests , it will spare no effort and use any means to get it .
The relationship between China and imperialist America is like that between the sheep and the wolf , and do n't expect the wolf to change its ambition ,
the wolf and the sheep can never be friends , even if so , it 's only an illusion on our part , it 's only a wolf in sheep 's clothing .
Ultimately , it will reveal its wolf nature , and I hope the sheep will not be fooled by it .
The whole world expects China and America to coexist peacefully , jointly preside over and deal with international affairs , and build a peaceful new international order .
The peaceful coexistence of China and America is also the common wish of the people in the two countries .
Nevertheless , the peace we aspire to will be only our good wish .
China is the fallen petals that have the intention , but imperialist America is the heartless flowing water .
Maintaining friendly relations with imperialist America is only the wishful thinking of some Chinese !
Though there is a great distance between China and America and there are no territorial disputes , unlike our relationship with the Polar Bear , there is a direct conflict of interest .
However , due to ideological difference between China and America and the lack of the necessary trust and communication in handling international affairs , it is particularly imperialist America , in its effort to contain the development of China and its threat to its hegemonic position , that makes trouble wherever possible to constrain the takeoff of the Chinese dragon .
Actually , imperialist America has the initiative in terms of whether the two major countries , China and America can get along ,
China has done a lot , and sacrificed a lot , for the Sino - American relationship ,
out of its wishful thinking , China uses its warm face to caress the cold ass of imperialist America , but it is still unable to win imperialistic America 's sincerity , causing the Sino - American relationship to waver and even fall backwards .
In future times , as China challenges its world hegemony and imperialist America attempts to retain it , more clashes will happen , conflicts will be inevitable , and the struggle will become ever more ferocious .
In recent years , as China 's reform and opening - up campaign has reached greater depths , the people 's living standards have improved substantially , and its defense and military strength has also developed rapidly .
The status of China as a major world power has begun to be more prominent , and in dealing with and directing international affairs , China has played an ever more important role .
China 's rapid growth and rise has gradually threatened and challenged the hegemonic position of imperialist America .
This makes imperialist America restless , and it has devised every possible means to contain and check China 's development .
Imperialist America wants to upset and restrain China with its military sales to Taiwan and the Taiwan issue !
The Taiwan issue has become an everlasting sorrow in the hearts of all descendants of China .
Imperialist America wants to control the Middle East and suppress Syria and Iran mainly because it covets the important strategic location and abundant resources of the Middle East .
Imperialist America wants to overthrow the Bashar regime to get rid of the Polar Bear 's only military base in the Middle East ! It does not want the influence of the Polar Bear to exist in the Middle East region over the long term .
Imperialist America wants to topple Iran mainly to take on China , to control China 's resources and contain China 's development .
In addition , it also wants to suppress the Polar Bear and squeeze the living space of China and Russia .
In today 's world , the only countries that can constitute a threat to the hegemonic position of imperialist America are China and , to a lesser degree , the Polar Bear .
Imperialist America has had far - reaching strategic foresight , and each step it takes serves to consolidate its hegemony .
Imperialist America is suppressing China in an all - round way , and we can see imperialist America 's meddling presence in the economy , politics and military affairs .
Imperialist America has been supporting little Japan , India , the Philippine servants and the Vietnamese monkeys , disturbing the stable environment around China to disrupt the peaceful development and rise of China .
Imperialist America is now pompously returning to the Asia Pacific region and reshuffling its military deployment , directly targeting China .
Taiwan is the deepest pain for all Chinese , because imperialist America has long taken Taiwan as a pawn and used it as a bargaining chip in the struggle with China .
It 's a pity that many Chinese are still hoping to make friends with imperialist America and maintain a friendship with imperialist America from generation to generation .
Furthermore , the many strategic adjustments and ideas of imperialist America are all aimed at the rising China .
Many advanced weapons have been tailor - made for China .
Compatriots ! Wake up ! Imperialist America has already aimed its guns to our heads , do not keep daydreaming !
Imperialist America takes China as its prime rival and enemy , give up your fantasy that you can make friends with the enemy !
The best method is to make good use of our time to step up our own defense and military construction , cast away all the illusions , and get ready for war !
Our ancestors wisely said , " Harbor no ill intention against others , but never relax one 's vigilance " !
This is the necessary psychology for getting along with friends , but at this moment imperialist America is our enemy staring like a tiger watching its prey , making it more necessary for us to remain vigilant at this time !
China has made a lot of sacrifices to improve its relations with imperialist America , and China has all along tried to become friends with imperialist America ,
although China now needs a peaceful and stable environment for its development , we ca n't make continual investments without any return .
Can Sino - American relations be improved ? Is friendly development possible ? The key question lies with imperialist America , not China .
Imperialist America has always held the initiative in the development of Sino - American relations .
In fact , it is not difficult for China and America to become friends , because China and America , despite their ideological differences , have no land or territorial disputes .
Though China and America have fought each other on the battlefield , the wars were not directly between China and America .
If imperialist America sincerely wants to make friends with China , it must display its sincerity and let the Chinese people see actual actions and results .
For China , the greatest interest concerning imperialist America lies in the Taiwan issue .
If imperialist America can stop its military sales to Taiwan , provide no support to Taiwan , and ensure peace across the Taiwan Straits , it will allow China to accomplish its great cause of national reunification .
If it refrains from meddling in China 's internal human rights issues , and also does not intervene in other affairs such as Tibet , I believe that China will also sacrifice its other interests to reciprocate the good faith of imperialist America !
Only if imperialist America does this can China and America truly become friends and co - exist peacefully as friends from generation to generation .
Will imperialist America give up Taiwan ? Absolutely not !
Being used to being a hegemon , imperialist America likes to intervene in the internal affairs and human rights affairs of other countries , and Taiwan is the best chess piece for containing China , so I believe imperialist America will not easily let go of it !
There is even less possibility that it will tolerate a Chinese challenge to its position as the world hegemon !
In the years to come , instead of becoming friends , China and America will only become rivals and even enemies !
Therefore , it 's unnecessary to harbor any fantasies about imperialist America , China should fundamentally change its mentality , there is no need to fear imperialist America , and we should be ready for a military confrontations with imperialist America at any time .
Let 's win the respect of imperialist America and the whole world with our strength .
A peaceful rise is only our unilateral notion , because the big powers of the world will not accept the appearance of a powerful China .
Only baptized by war can China really become a world power .
The Chinese should be ever vigilant and not be deceived by the present peace , active war preparation is the only right choice ,
only when our defense and military have become strong , will we be able to eradicate all aggressors , and only through the baptism of war can China become a truly powerful country .
In my personal opinion , there must be a war between China and America in the future !
What China needs to do is to cast away its illusions and get ready for war .
China Mobile is no doubt a monopolized operator in China , the biggest mobile phone market in the world . It has also expressed clearly its ambition to step outside the country and participate in global competitions .
Even though the performances of Chinese companies are not outstanding in the course of globalization , Wang Jianzhou , President and CEO of China Mobile , is determined to change all this .
On the eve of the Business Week CEO Forum held in Beijing on November 1 , Wang Jianzhou gave an exclusive interview to the editor of the Business Week .
He stated that the objective of China Mobile is to become a world - class company .
Wang Jianzhou , 57 , said in fluent English that China Mobile , which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange , has close to 300 million mobile phone users in mainland China , an equivalent of the entire population of the United States .
This signifies that China Mobile occupies almost 70 percent of the market share in mainland China .
Li Yanhong , Zhang Chaoyang , Shen Nanpeng , Ma Huateng ...
In the past 10 years , behind these Chinese high - tech magnates who emerged one after another was sure to be the shadow of the U.S. owned International Data Group ( IDG ) .
The annual IDG Conference was held in Sanya , Hainan on November 3 .
Apart from the seven partners , who are called the ' Seven Swords ' inside IDG , the participants also included over 190 CEOs of companies that IDG invested in and representatives from investment banks and consulting agencies .
According to the practice of the past six years , after each IDG conference , there will always be some participants who make the list of magnates of the year .
I insisted on not paying him . Finally , he cracked and fled in panic .
However , I was also at the verge of collapse because the people 's police at 110 whom I looked forward to still had not arrived yet .
These days , overseas study has become popular . To friends and relatives , it 's a proud thing to be mentioned .
Children of the rich and government officials , who does n't want to enhance their status through overseas study ?
Let alone that getting oneself a western diploma will make getting a good job easier in the future . Even old dad and mom making a parade of it everywhere would look exceedingly good !
However , those in middle class families or even laid - off workers see those children of the wealthy and powerful go overseas , come back cloaked in glory and all have a good future ( they do n't know that family wealth and good backgrounds of those are the only real guarantees ) . How wonderful ! Thereupon , they pinch and scrape to send their child overseas ,
It seems that once they are sent overseas , nothing but a wonderful future and unlimited glory will return .
Nowadays , it is more often the case that those who do n't pass the university entrance exam and are wasting their days at home without doing anything are sent overseas . With a bit of " toughening up " , everything will be okay .
Wrong ! With a huge chunk of cash spent , the frightening thing is that the payoff falls far short of expectations .
Even more frightening is that it holds the child back .
I 've been in France for several years !
What I have experienced myself or , even more , what I have seen are the countless who have given up their studies year by year , those with wrecked health everywhere , those who sold their souls and even those who lost their lives .
Overseas study is a splendid term , but in return it demands youth , effort and staunch perseverance , as well as sufficient rationality .
Life is never a bed of roses in any location , even more in a foreign land where there is a language barrier , different customs and no family or friends .
Malformed society
The proposal on " the transfer of reproduction rights " is originate from the same track the proposal on " controlling the number of rural children going to college " ! What else are these representatives if not do - nothing politicians ?
Fuck you ! Go to hell ! Fuck your mother !
Complete and obvious bullshit ! More sinister than directly selling and buying infants !
Can China still be saved ?
The one - child policy is the most insidious policy , thoroughly antihuman and racially discriminatory , an open trampling on the right of survival right for Han people as a whole . Those who formulated and implemented this policy are all fascists ; they should be brought to trial at the International Court , and the people principally responsible for it should be hanged .
This guy really is a " representative " , a - ha .
As known to all , Shanghai and Hong Kong have very low birth rates and mainly depend on migrants to maintain their population sizes and keep their populations young ; there is good economic development ;
In recent years , due to labor shortages , millions of black people and Southeast Asians have come to the southeast , and have caused varied degrees of deterioration in social order .
Just like Shanghai and Hong Kong , China depends on immigrants and at the same time pursues the one - child policy , making the planning policy look like a very clever policy !
Shanghai and Hong Kong maintain their social development by absorbing migrants from other provinces , what will happen if China prepares herbal medicine by the prescribed method and absorbs foreigners ?
Do n't wait till the situation has become unmanageable and then drive away the gypsies as Sarkozy did ; German Chancellor Angela Merkel has just recently declared that Germany has failed to build a diversified society and will limit the development of the immigrant population ; now that the sheep have been stolen , no choice but to mend the fold !
Before long , the dividends for the population would wear out . As immigrant laborers swarmed in ( these people are not subject to family planning ) , the population would soon experience racial replacement , and China , as Yugoslavia did , would soon disintegrate !
The blacks , Arabs , and Vietnamese , one after another , would demand their rights , autonomy , and independence !
One after another , the local areas would become independent , as Kosovo did !
The minority peoples in Xinjiang and Tibet can bear more children , causing the proportion of the Han people compared to the population of the frontier ethnic regions to decline quickly ;
The regiments of troops and Sichuan women that such national heroes as Zuo Zongtang and Wang Zhen took great pains to transplant into Xinjiang and Tibet are being quickly exterminated by the one - child policy ; the undercurrents of Xinjiang Independence and Tibetan Independence are getting ever more rampant !
The family planning policy and the one - child policy have put the country in an dangerous as stacking eggs , and posed a threat to the survival of the nation .
Family planning has effectively reduced the Chinese population by 300 million , postponing the Day of 7 Billion by 3 years ; According to the plan of the Planning Commission , even if the Chinese population is reduced by 1 billion , the Day of 7 Billion will be postponed for just another few years !
But the Chinese nation will be on the brink of extinction . Such selfless notions which nobody will have until evolving into a nonhuman creature , surprisingly , has become a reality in China !
The issues of population and ethnical structure are major issues for the survival of the country !
Family planning is part of the plan to massively exterminate the Han people , and the beginning of dividing China !
The family planning policy is extremely stupid and the ultimate in self - castration . It is unprecedented from a historic perspective and will be unmatchable in the future ; and in the global perspective , it is totally unique !
The self - harming policy fully embodies the malice of the enemy and the stupidity of the those in power , brings disasters to both the country and the people , is totally void of conscience , contributes nothing to the contemporary time , leaves a legacy of trouble for a long time in future , and will definitely become a joke that those throughout all history will ridicule !
The other day , Xinwen Lianbo reported that the difficulty for enterprises to hire workers has extended to the west and swept the whole country !
The family planning policy is extremely stupid , brings disasters to both the country and the people , and is totally void of conscience !
Improving Population Quality Requires Transferring Reproduction Rights to the Rich ?
Through free exchanges on the market , nearly everything can be bought and sold .
Today , the right to bear a second child is also becoming a popular product with the rich .
They have money to buy the right , to bear the child , and to raise the child .
As to these transfers and transactions of the right to bear a second child , let 's have a look at how the representatives argued and legally struggled with government officials at the " Two Meetings " .
Why did they propose such a transfer on the right to bear a second child ?
To this question , Li Xinghao - the author of this proposal , NPC representative and Chairman of Zhigao Group , said that such a transfer is beneficial to improving the quality of the population .
Transferred to which kind of person , exactly ?
This representative identified 3 groups : First , people with strong educational backgrounds ; second , the rich class ; third , civil servants .
Li Xinghao asserts that " In today 's society , people with strong educational backgrounds , the rich class , and civil servants have relatively high social status , relatively good economics means , and can ensure basic educational conditions and a good environment for the newborn population to develop in " .
Why is such transfer practical ?
Li Xinghao gave his own specific explanation from the angle of market supply and demand .
He said , " For a transfer , people are not classified into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not .
He said that the original motive for this proposal was rooted in his discovery that some families legally allowed to bear a second child , due to their poverty and other reasons , would become even more impoverished if they were to do so ;
while some rich families had a strong desire to bear a second child but did not have the allowance to do so .
He thinks that this conflict really exists , and the relevant governmental departments can take the initiative to establish a transfer platform . "
This transfer proposal by Representative Li is indeed very smart .
On the one hand , it helps the government to reduce and narrow the gap of wealth ;
on the other hand , it also solves the structural conflict of the reproduction right market - the poor have allowances but cannot afford the birth and upbringing , while the rich want to bear children but do n't have the allowance .
Based on Representative Li 's proposal , the rich will voluntarily reduce their per capita wealth by bearing and raising more children , while the poor will increase their per capita wealth by bearing and raising fewer children .
Through such transfers and transactions of the right to bear a second child between the rich and the poor , the government can unnoticeably narrow the ever - increasing gap between the poor and the rich without spending a single cent .
How can the wealth gap be narrowed through such transfer ?
This Representative Li has envisioned a fast track for the get - rich - first people to guide and assist the get - rich - later people . That is , " the allowance transferee shall give the transferor ' an entire sequence ' of help and support . "
" According to Li Xinghao 's plan , through lottery - type drawing , the transfer platform establishes a one - on - one guidance and assistance relationship between the transferee and the transferor .
As part of the assistance , the couple applying for the allowance to be transferred in to them will buy the transferring couple all the basic insurances currently required by the government , including social insurance , medical insurance , and personal accident insurance , and will continue to provide them with a minimum living guarantee for the rest of their lives .
Meanwhile , the applicant couple will also provide financial support for the education of the transferring couple 's child until he or she graduates from university .
What 's more , if the transferring couple intend to register as permanent urban residents , the applicant couple shall buy them a 35m2 socially subsidized apartment in the city where the applicants dwell , but all of the transferring couple 's land use rights in the countryside will belong to the applicant couple . "
What do our family planning officials think of this proposal that the State " utilize the transferring of rights to bear a second - child to improve the population quality and make the get - rich - first help the get - rich - later so as to realize common prosperity " ?
In response , " Yesterday , Zhang Feng , Director of Guangdong Provincial Family Planning Commission , made his stance clear to the media that the right to reproduce is absolutely not transferrable .
In the event that the right to reproduce is transferred , it would not only be a violation of law , but also bring moral questions if it involved a transaction . "
Through transferring their right to bear a second child and the concomitant obligations imposed on the transferees , the poor can get rich with the guidance and assistance from the get - rich - first class , if the proposal can pass and become law , the poor undoubtedly have found in the rich class , well - educated class , and the bureaucratic class an obedient son to provide for them up until they die . Marvelous indeed .
He claims it is not a transaction , but how can it be otherwise ? In this bundle of obligations for common prosperity , where is the dignity of the poor ?
Does not the bundle of obligations proposed by this Representative Li still imply a contract on the exchange and transaction of land use rights ?
Certainly , without such exchange of interests , why would the rich take an interest in providing for the children of the poor ?
If the legislature really wants to adopt this proposal on the premise of the get - rich - first class leading the get - rich - later class to become rich by giving them one - on - one guidance and assistance so as to improve our population quality and narrow our wealth gap , it must ensure fairness in such exchange of interests and during the transfer .
Transferred together with a wet nurse .
Following it with interest .
For a transfer of the right to marry , people are not classified into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not . Since I discovered that some men who have a legal right to marry , due to their poverty and other reasons , would become even more impoverished if they did marry ;
while some rich men have a strong desire to marry N concubines ( because their mistresses often fuss about wanting to get married ) but they do not have the allowance , and would be guilty of bigamy .
I think that this conflict really exists , and the relevant governmental departments can take the initiative to establish a platform to transfer the right to marry .
Pillaging the flesh till the bones are seen ?
Interesting ... interesting
Logic of hooligans .
Directly transfer the wife
A pack of luxury cigarettes ranges from as little as a few tens of yuan to more than a hundred yuan , if you smoke a stick , you are puffing away one month 's salary for an ordinary worker .
If it was bought with public funds , it may be said that what they are smoking are not cigarettes but the " blood and sweat " of the taxpayers .
NPC Representative Ma Wenfang proposed that consumption of tobacco products on public expenses should be universally banned .
There are of course many reasons as to why we lag far behind in meeting our tobacco control objectives .
But one of the undisputable reasons is that a huge smoker 's group exists within our huge contingent of civil servants .
Among this legion of smokers , a considerable number smoke " free cigarettes " which they do n't have to buy with their own money , as they were received as gifts or bought with public funds .
It is precisely because they are not using their own money that they usually smoke luxury cigarettes which are unaffordable for most people .
Their track performance for blowing smoke rings also has a compounding effect in repeatedly setting new records for consumption expenses by civil servants , and it has become an organic portion of officialdom corruption as a whole .
It was precisely this horrifying social backdrop that prompted NPC Representative Ma Wenfang to solemnly set forth her proposal that consumption of tobacco products on public funds be universally banned .
In our country , there are many civil servants who think their family name is " Gong " and such that every expense incurred by them , regardless of whether it is for public or private purpose , should be borne by the public . Therefore , consumption on public expenses can involve almost everything imaginable .
For instance , besides luxury cigarettes , other examples include luxury liquor , fine wining and dining , luxury cars , and overseas tours , and whatever luxury enjoyment and extravagant entertainment they can imagine , they would want to have them all and enjoy them to fullest , using public funds to settle the bill in full .
If the supreme authorities had to draw up separate regulatory documents to address every single item for consumption on public expenses for nationwide circulation in order to check such extravagances , the mountain of documents will really extend towards the sky .
In fact , all that needs to be done is to clearly include tobacco products within the anti - corruption regulations ' relevant clauses for prohibition of consumption on public funds , and it will suffice .
As for the remaining issues , we must ensure that the orders and prohibitions are fully enforced . If any civil servant dares to violate the law , he will be severely punished according to the law and regulations .
If this was really carried out in all localities at every level , there would be no cause to worry that the corrupt practice of consumption on public expenses , including smoking on public funds , cannot be curbed .
After deputies and committee members have moved into their quarters in the hotel , how would service staff greet them ?
Some greet them with " Deputy So - and - so " or " Committee Member So - and - so ; " while some call NPC deputies " chief , " which makes some deputies , especially deputies from the grass - roots level , feel somewhat embarrassed . Some deputies even request service staff to " not call me chief . "
Calling deputies and committee members who have moved into their quarters in the hotel " chief " is , of course , out of the hotel service staff member 's formal respect , but it has actually caused misunderstanding of the identity of deputy or committee member .
As major national events , the convening of the two conferences has clearly provided the path ahead for our development .
However , at the two conferences , according to common sense , the identity of " deputy " or " committee member " is generally used , that is , " Deputy xx " or " Committee Member xx . " But I cannot say much for the mention of " deputy as a chief . "
Through the subtlety of greeting , we can see common people 's sense of awe towards " deputies " and " committee members . "
Actually , when providing services to deputies and committee members , what 's wrong with being a bit simple ?
Would n't it appear more cordial to directly greet them as " Deputy xx " or " Committee Member xx ? "
After greeting them as chiefs , do n't you have a sense of awe and awkwardness ?
As deputies , they should equally treasure their own first identity . Deputy or committee member is neither an administrative official post nor a honorary title . This identity means enormous responsibility .
At the " times of the two conferences , " deputies and committee members should have an even heightened sense of responsibility . No matter what kind of social status you yourself have , remember firmly your own first identity and most important identity is a deputy , a committee member .
This is just a tidbit at the two conferences . The conferences that follow will unfold more exciting contents in front of us .
They are scumbags
Gosh , they even dare to use the word ' awe . ' Common people could n't wait to ' despise ' them , how could they have a sense of ' awe ? '
What would you say , which thingy there is publicly elected by common people formed by the first , second , and third person such as you , me , and him ?
Before the two national conferences were convened , various major news websites and periodicals across the country in succession invited netizens and readers nationwide to submit " suggestions for the two conferences . "
This writer from " suggestions for the two conferences " submitted by netizens across the country on various major news websites on the central government 's strengthening of efforts to oppose corruption and promote honest government , better supervision of the government and officials , and severe punishment for people engaged in embezzlement and corruption .
When CPPCC delegate Mao Xinyu checked in to attend the " two conferences " and spoke of a motion he proposed this year , he said the emphasis was on anti - corruption efforts .
The anti - corruption drive involves everyone , from the ordinary people below up to and including the delegates to the two conferences .
At present , public expenditure on food and entertainment nationwide has already reached 300 billion a year .
Such a huge figure for public expenditure on food and entertainment crowds out expenditure on things vital for people 's welfare , including education , hygiene , healthcare , and social security .
Figures listed in a bill drawn up by the Jiusan Society 's central organization before the two conference in 2012
are really unbelievable : annual public expenditure on food and entertainment actually reaches 300 billion ! How large is this figure of 300 billion ?
If we saved this 300 billion and invested it in the economically undeveloped and impoverished regions in China , how many schools could we build ?
How many poor families could we assist ? How many children forced to leave school could we assist ?
It 's a pity that this 300 billion is squandered with no results , wasted in the pursuit of debauchery , by corrupt officials - How could our people not hate the " parasites " hidden among the membership ranks of the Communist Party ?
When corruption among government officials is brought up , the ordinary people all gnash their teeth , but the ordinary people are , after all , the ordinary people , and can only look on helplessly in silent fury .
The ordinary people cannot afford to upset government officials , for if the ordinary people dared to upset government officials , they would be cracking eggs against rocks . Not only could they get more than they bargained for ; if something went wrong , they could end up in prison , or even endanger their lives .
Every year , there are cases across the country where ordinary people , because of reporting government officials , suffer the disaster of imprisonment if they get up lightly or the disaster of death if they are dealt with harshly .
It is common for ordinary people , with no other means of redress , to post on the Internet out of resentment against savage land requisitions or the savage demolition of homes and forced relocation by local government officials , but what fate do they often bring on themselves ?
Local government officials easily pin some labels on you , and you can even be chased and arrested by public security bodies across provincial boundaries .
The most terrible thing is not the government officials , but the power that lies in the hands of these officials .
How can we prevent the " three types of consumption on public funds ? "
If we are to prevent the " three types of consumption on public funds , " we must first " block " the officials ' mouths ,
but this is easier said than done . Why ?
As people working in a lower - level work unit , if leaders from higher - level work units come , do you dare not to entertain them in the most respectful way with nice things to eat and drink ?
If they are not entertained well with nice things to eat and drink , after they 've gone , will officials in the lower - level work unit still have a future ?
To their subordinates , senior leaders are all their " masters . " You ca n't afford to upset any of them , and whoever upsets them is in for it . If you rub them up the wrong way when you 're trying to butter them up , you wo n't just jeopardize your official position , you wo n't even know what the consequences will be .
To stop the " three types of consumption on public funds , " senior officials must first " block " their own mouths .
In April 2011 , when the no. 6 inspection group of Hubei 's provincial party committee went to Yichang city on an inspection tour of Zigui county , a national - level impoverished county , the local government officials were both delighted and worried .
What delighted them was that they had an opportunity to report their problems to senior leaders and have them taken seriously by them , and what worried them was that there were 13 people in the inspection group , coming for 20 days or so , and the entertainment expenses , the cost of the gifts , and the inspection fees and various other items of expenditure would altogether come to 801,900 yuan .
How could this national - level impoverished county pay the bills ?
This example is the best illustration that if we are to prevent the " three types of consumption on public funds , " we must first stop the senior government officials .
If the upper beams are correctly placed , the lower beams will not go awry .
If the central state authorities are to stop the " three types of consumption on public funds , " they must dare to do what they mean .
It should be said that wining and dining on public funds as pointed out by scholars is an objective reality .
With the increasing prevalence of the alcohol culture at the grass - roots institutions , alcohol has already been fermented and adulterated by the so - called " bureaucratic culture " beyond recognition .
Some people put on high - end wine banquets trying to please their superiors , some people use alcohol as gifts to seek personal gain , some people consider it a type of pleasure to get people to drink by using beer games , and some people get carried away because of their addiction to alcohol or drunkenness , adversely affecting their work .
Every year the amounts of food trashed and money wasted as a result of wining and dining on public funds are even more appalling .
This writer has lived for a long time at the grass - roots level and often heard and witnessed some grass - roots officials almost sitting at meal gatherings or attending banquets every day , and never getting tired of it .
How much is the wining and dining expense at the grass - roots level in one year ? A specific number is virtually never published .
Actually , the insiders are well aware that this is a considerably high expenditure .
Who should be blamed for the grass - roots officials ' wining and dining becoming common practice ?
Speaking with regard to the grass - roots levels , it is indeed necessary to conduct rectification and to straighten things up according to the relevant regulations , but focusing on the grass - roots levels alone may not be enough .
Throughout the year , various types of inspection groups and investigation groups , as numerous as the hairs on an ox , come and go in an endless stream , also making the grass - roots institutions overburdened . Some grass - roots leading cadres , with no choice but to run between the various dinner parties every day , also feel somewhat helpless .
There are also many people wallowing in the array of wine glasses and poker chips becoming " vessels for wine and bags for food . "
This writer met with some township officials . Facing more and more dinner parties , many of them are fed up with it , but also feel forced and helpless .
The reasoning they explained is that entertaining is just for solving problems .
A township official , using his fingers to count , told this writer that in order to solve financial , road repair , canal construction projects and so on , they must entertain the relevant personnel and department heads , otherwise it will be of no avail .
When I look back to all these years , the urban construction in Beijing has experienced rapid development .
Some people said that it borrowed the easterly wind of the Olympics . However , I think otherwise .
Even though the 2008 Olympics allowed Beijing to display its charisma in front of cameras of all caliber that frocked in from all sides ,
it has almost been four years since the Olympics and the urban development in Beijing still has not stopped .
Speaking of urban development , the most representative one is none other than the Beijing subway .
Those who were born and raised in Beijing in the 80s can almost be called the generation who grew up sitting on the subway .
The public transportation then could not be considered as convenient compared to now . Buses could hardly be said as providing easy access to all directions .
However , with their extensive coverage , the two subway lines provided novelty and convenience to many Beijing residents and visitors who travelled from afar .
The subway is a distinguishing traffic feature of Beijing . As one of the first Chinese cities to have underground transportation , the emergence of subway has provided everyone more choices .
This underground railway line that runs through eastern and western Beijing has become Beijing 's symbol of alternative culture .
Day by day , Beijing is developing , so are its public transport and highways . Eventually , it will usher in the alarming data of 5 million cars in 2012 .
Meanwhile , the crowded highways and complicated road traffic cause people to have greater expectations in the development of the subway .
I have to applaud the continuous increase in the efforts in subway construction of Beijing in all these years when I talk about subway development .
In July 2001 , with the success in the bid to host the Olympics , Beijing subway Line 13 also ushered in the completion of the entire line and became the newest member of the Beijing subway family .
Meanwhile , in October 2007 , the closely watched subway Line 5 went into operation . It became the new trunk that links southern and northern Beijing and intersects with Line 1 .
While Beijing residents enjoyed the modernization of subway Line 5 , in July 2008 , the first phase of construction of subway Line 10 and in September 2009 , subway Line 4 and Line 8 all became operational one after another . At the same time , all suburban districts and counties are all connected by the subway successively .
In about 10 years time , the Beijing subway transformed from an underground supplementary means of transport that only had two lines to a 15 - lined underground transportation network that covers almost the entire Beijing from Changping in the north to Daxing in the south , Mentougou in the west , and Tongzhou District in the east .
Such rapid development was almost unimaginable by anyone and unachievable by any country .
While 2012 is quickly approaching , there is even the spectacular scene of four lines opening at the same time . It is veritably " putting all firepower into operation " !
The rapid coverage of underground transportation has brought along prosperity to surrounding communities of the subway . Residents no longer have to worry about which bus route to take when they go out .
More residents gladly choose to travel by subway . It is both convenient and cozy .
Needless to say , the subway has brought about convenience to the travel and work of the residents . More commendable is that the convenient subway has allowed more residents to give up their cars and choose such green means of transportation that is environmental friendly .
Not only does a reduction in cars on the road alleviate traffic pressure on the road ; it also reduces the pressure of air pollution so that more residents can cheer for the blue sky of Beijing from their heart .
These are all contributions of the subway . Yet , where did the contributions of the subway come from ? They were naturally from the rapid development of the subway in Beijing within these 10 years .
The development of the subway is the same as the rapid global development of the city of Beijing , it will become a permanent city symbol of Beijing and a benefiting project that earns the satisfaction of the residents and the respect of the world .
Beijing Forces Ma Ying - jeou to Declare Stand on Unification , Taiwan Can No Longer Turn Back
It can be said that the elections that cover five major cities have stirred up a storm in Taiwan .
In the midst of all this commotion , James Soong made a sudden appearance to come head to head with Ma Ying - jeou in the elections .
This made the already worried Ma Ying - jeou even more anxious , but there is nothing he can do .
This is linked to the earlier stand mainland China made regarding military cooperation with Taiwan . In addition , James Soong has expressed clearly that his taking part in the elections is to tell Ma Ying - jeou that he had worked hard to get the 1992 Consensus from mainland China and Ma should not let everyone down .
Regarding the chaos in Taiwan and the future ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan , what else do we still need to face ? What else do we have to do ?
Regarding the " weathervane " of Ma Ying - jeou 's stand , what other preparations should we make ?
James Soong 's transfer of allegiance is to force the undecided Ma Ying - jeou to declare his stand on the ultimate unification
Soong 's transfer of allegiance is , in a certain sense , a kind of response to mainland China 's intention .
On the issue of mainland China and Taiwan , Ma Ying - jeou has gotten a lot of room for maneuvering ,
from playing the Taiwan independence card for the sake of the elections to playing the card of attacking mainland China and achieving military balance for the sake of the elections . However , on the issue of the ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan , not only did Ma Ying - jeou fail to make any progress , he even took a big step backward .
In the past , he was standing close to the middle . Now , he is starting to gradually follow the footsteps of the DPP . He keeps pushing the bottom line of mainland China for the mere sake of manipulating the elections . Furthermore , he completely ignores the compromises made by mainland China and the effort it has put in for peaceful unification .
To save the Taiwanese economy , mainland China has made huge policy adjustments such as absorbing Taiwan 's excess industrial capacity , buying Taiwan 's excess agricultural products , giving several Taiwanese political figures room for international affairs to carry out international affairs , etc.
However , after all this waiting , in the end it has to face Ma Ying - jeou'a a double - headed snake that is seemingly false and real at the same time .
Therefore , facing this undecided Ma Ying - jeou , James Soong stepped up to defend mainland China !
Is n't Ma Ying - jeou wanting to score more points for his selection ? Is n't he wanting to elevate his position through manipulating the people ?
The moment James Soong appeared , the situation changed ! This is to force Ma Ying - jeou to stop manipulating the elections and declare his stand on the ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan !
Ma Ying - jeou is Not Mainland China 's Only Choice , But Mainland China is Going to Be Ma Ying - jeou 's Only Choice
So , what cards is Old Ma left with to play ?
Military purchase - fetus died in the womb ;
economic development - eclipsed by the prosperity of mainland China ;
culture - fully integrated with mainland China as well ;
as for military affairs - Taiwanese soldiers , whether ex - service or in service , are all under the control of mainland China 's military departments .
As for the key Taiwanese figures who hold military power , mainland China has long ago convinced them with reasons .
Fellow countrymen should not slaughter one another , and brothers should not turn against one another - this makes the Taiwanese military less hostile towards mainland China .
As for the withdrawal of missiles proposed by Ma Ying - jeou , it is also no longer an issue now .
So what is Ma Ying - jeou still waiting for ? For a major change to take place in Taiwan ?
To mainland China , Ma Ying - jeou is no longer mainland China 's only choice .
Mainland China is actively seeking all forces in Taiwan that can be sought . Even the DPP is starting to change its course .
However , Ma Ying - jeou , who is holding on and keeping his mouth tight , has no other choices except mainland China , in other words , mainland China is Ma Ying - jeou 's only choice .
Basically , all the big bosses of the Kuomintang have visited mainland China and even received VIP treatment , getting all the respect they deserved .
So , is Ma Ying - jeou thinking about his future position or the great cause of the national unification ?
Ma Ying - jeou might offend some people in Taiwan who are eager to achieve Taiwan independence , but Ma Ying - jeou can gain the respect of the entire Chinese population of 1.4 billion . Comparing the two , it should be clear which is important and which is not .
When Nixon visited China back then , he turned the Sino - American relationship around . So , does n't Ma Ying - jeou want his name to go down in history ?
Could it be that being the bill of a chicken is really better than being the anus of an ox ?
Hence , Ma Ying - jeou should understand that he is only one of the choices of mainland China . It is up to him whether he wants to achieve success and acquire fame .
Watch out for Ma Ying - jeou 's Continued Military Resistance against Unification by the Lease - to - own method
Though the United States has recently increased its military presence in the Asia Pacific region , it is showing a rare undecided stand on the Taiwan issue .
The United States is no longer able to tell where Taiwan is heading , because all Taiwanese senior politicians are talking about unification and there is less and less talk about secession .
Furthermore , a certain tacit agreement between mainland China and Taiwan regarding the Diaoyu Islands has made the United States feel somewhat unable to do what it wants to do .
However , some people from the United States and Taiwan are still somewhat intelligent .
They no longer talk about military purchase but started proposing a lease - to - own method for Taiwan to get weapons .
The weapons Taiwan has now are old .
The lease - to - own method might bring some advantages in conducting cutting - edge military confrontation with mainland China , but fundamentally speaking , Taiwan no longer has the strength to fight against mainland China .
If it continues to take its old path of resisting unification through military forces , then it will meet a very tragic ending !
Diaoyu Islands Will be a Touchstone - Taiwan Can No Longer Turn Back
Of course , there are still many opportunities for mainland China and Taiwan . For example , the Diaoyu Islands is the first touchstone of cooperation between mainland China and Taiwan .
When it comes to the Diaoyu Islands , mainland China and Taiwan can jointly deploy naval vessels , jointly defend the Diaoyu Islands , and join hands in fighting Japan .
Recently , within Taiwan , active actions have been taken concerning the ownership of Taiwan as well .
For example , there have been active changes as to how the Japan issue is treated , how the historical issue of the resistance war is treated , and how the issue of Taiwan as part of mainland China in the past is treated .
It is these changes that made the entire Taiwan , from top to bottom , reach a consensus that it can survive by staying close to mainland China .
Facing mainland China 's offensive efforts towards unification , Taiwan can no longer turn back .
Taiwan will become another traitor if it goes into Japan 's embrace . Only by going into mainland China 's embrace will Taiwan have a bright future !
In short , James Soong is merely someone through whom mainland China 's stance ranging from active cooperation to slight warning is demonstrated .
If Ma Ying - jeou does not want to oversleep after going back to bed in the morning , he must truly face what the people of both sides of the Strait have been hoping for for a century !
It is up to him whether he wants to be a sinner of the nation or a meritorious contributor to the nation !
When that time comes , the people of mainland China will respond enthusiastically to Ma Ying - jeou !
What 's going on !
Damn , these people who do n't learn to be good should rot at home . Why are they coming out ?
Endangering the society !
Really , one should not be a Samaritan
If you help the other person get up but she does not appreciate it and even pushes you , then you should not help her anymore .
Yet you help her again ...
Do n't tell jokes at the seaside . It will trigger tsunami
It is really too tragic
Meeting violence with violence does not benefit anyone
Woes of the society .
Those who make trouble after getting drunk should be punished without leniency . Detestable
The following is a quote from Qiuyeyuanmaoerkong from the second posting :
The perpetrators are not going to be held responsible just because they said they are poor ! ? Who dares to be a Samaritan in future ! ? ...
It is really tough being a good person .
The old man was looking for trouble ...
Nowadays , there are many scumbags around ~
The following is a quote from * Miyamiya * from the seventh posting :
Nowadays , one should not do evil , but one should not do good , either
Damn , nowadays one should not be a good person

This is well said ...
This is what you call unforeseen misfortune
People say , do not do good things . He did n't listen ... sigh ,
Scary
The following is a quote from Ninth Inspiration from the tenth posting :
What 's going on ! Damn , these people who do n't learn to be good should rot at home . Why are they coming out ? Endangering the society ! ...
Why did n't they get knocked down by a car and die after getting drunk ? Scumbags !

Woes of the society ...
Good people are beaten into extinction just like this , they 're all done for
Right , you 're so old , why did you go and help a young man up ... It 's tough to be a good person
It 's tough to be a good person
Never be a good person ... Always remember ...
If severe punishment is not given , in future everyone will pretend to be drunk and make trouble

A Letter from the Victim 's Family
First of all , I would like to thank a kind - hearted person for calling the police immediately . I would also like to thank the public security authority for the prompt capture of the perpetrators .
Early in the morning on September 1 , my father , as usual , was riding his bicycle to Gucheng Park for exercise . At Jiuli Street , he saw someone lying on the side of the road , and so , out of kindness , he went up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon . Then , three people ran up to him , kicking and beaing him ( according to the police , they had drunk four cases of beer at the time ) . As a result , my father 's skull suffered serious injury . He bled profusely and lost consciousness . By the time he was taken to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated . However , with prompt rescue given by a doctor , he survived . As there was serious bleeding , the doctor performed a life - saving surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father 's head to remove blood clots . Due to profuse bleeding , some of the blood had already flowed into the brainstem and bottom of the brain , putting his life in danger .
Right now , my father is in very serious condition . On September 1 , he underwent a 5 - hour craniotomy . On September 2 , he had a tracheotomy and a respirator was used to help him breathe . Currently , he is still unconscious . After these few days of hospital treatment , he is sometimes able to move his arms and feet , and he is showing signs of recovery .
As his children , we feel very terrible now . It has been six days since the incident . Under the police 's advice , the perpetrators finally gave 10,000 yuan . We have already delivered the money to the hospital . Now , almost 50,000 yuan has been spent on the medical bills . We do n't know when we can get money to pay for future medical bills .
We have now already received a payment reminder from the hospital . If we do not pay on time , the hospital will stop supplying medications . When that happens , I cannot bear to think of what will happen to my father .
Our family has very poor living conditions . My mother only gets a minimum welfare pay of 380 yuan , and she has diabetes . My father is a retired coking plant worker . His pay is also just a bit over 1,000 yuan . I am doing odd jobs at a factory , and I have not even made any medical insurance or pension contributions . My elder sister is also an odd - job worker . She has also not made any pension or medical insurance contributions . Furthermore , I am going to be a father soon . I have a very heavy family burden . Our family now can only rely on my father 's pay to survive . We absolutely cannot afford such high hospital costs .
It has been six days since the incident . As victims , we have the rights of a citizen to know some things :
1. Where are the perpetrators from ? How are their family and financial conditions ?
2. When can the case be submitted to the procuratorate ? When can public prosecution be initiated ?
3. We hope the perpetrators can cooperate actively and take practical actions to work together to first save my father 's life .
4. We request to meet the parents of the perpetrators .
We hope the news media can help us to jointly save the life of my kind - hearted father .
We also ask the government departments to coordinate with one another and be flexible to activate my father 's medical insurance card and save his life .
After the court verdict is out , all medical costs will be paid back to the medical insurance bureau .
A million thanks to the city residents and media for the concern they have shown us in this incident . May all you kind - hearted people have a life of peace !
Victim 's son
Why helped him up when he was sleeping happily ?
Faint . The social morality system is about to collapse . Everything must be torn down and start all over again . Sigh
Manhunt . Post the pictures of that bunch of perpetrators !
Tragedy
What a turbulent society

Hope the perpetrators can assume the responsibilities
Nowadays , to be a good person is really not something you can do casually . Hope the perpetrators can assume the responsibilities
Sentence all of them to life imprisonment and let 's see if they are going to pay
Poor old man . He 's still stuck in the era of learning from Lei Feng . The society today is a mess .
It 's tough to be a good person !
It 's tough to be a good person !
Punish severely ! It looks like we have to mind our own business !
It is legal as long as three hours of sunshine can be achieved .
Most high - rise buildings with a spacing of 100 meters can certainly achieve that .
Three hours of sunshine , from morning till night , can certainly be achieved .
Most sunlight issues raised by the elderly men and women are indeed not against the national requirements , so they 're merely unreasonable complaints of the elderly as a result of their perceived discomfort .
Even if there is a court judgment confirming that the developer is not against the law , they will still persist with their unreasonable demands .
Reply to Light - and - shadow - hero on the 10th floor :
Three hours of sunshine is a technical term . Sunlight analysis is needed . Setbacks of spacing are related to not only the sunshine spacing but also the floor thickness . A sunshine spacing coefficient of 1:1.4 can meet the requirement for three hours of sunshine on the day of Great Cold in Taizhou . All we want is that the developer does the job legally , and makes it clear that sunshine analysis has shown that the minimum national requirements can be met !
But what you said is also somewhat reasonable . The minimum standards are not acceptable to most people . They have a good reason to ask for more sunlight . However , this developer is too strong . We just want to secure the minimum legitimate interests according to the national regulations , but even that is so difficult for us !
Guanxi and operations , alas .
I remain poised
China : There are too many issues now ! Is that because good officials are too few ?
Developers always want to make more money . We have a building here , which has not been pulled down so far even after exposed by CCTV . How powerful the developers are .
The following is a quotation of All owners of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 's words on the 1st floor :
All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in General Secretary Hu 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer ! ...
Uh ... Do you have legislative power or enforcement power ?
In Zhenjiang , Jiangsu , an old man doing morning exercise helped a drunk man up and was mistaken as a thief and badly beaten up
Five young men who work as chefs at Zhenjiang Hotel were strolling on the street in the early morning on the 2nd after downing several bottles of beer .
One of the men , Ji , squatted on the stone step of a bus stop .
Mr. Yang , an old man from Zhenjiang who is in his 60s , was passing by while on his morning exercise . After seeing that , he asked Ji to go home soon , and then held out his hands to help Ji up .
However , Ji mistook Mr. Yang for wanting to steal his things , so immediately together with Wu and Ma , he battered the old man violently till he was seriously injured !
Murderers all go for the head !
I think they meant to kill him !
Latest news : Victim Mr. Yang passed away around 9 a.m. on 9/13/2011 . Perpetrators remain under criminal detention .
However , this incident has not yet come to a close . The victim 's family may still have to wait for the police to conduct an autopsy on the victim .
Regarding this incident , both sides involved have posted relevant comments in this thread . They are in postings no. 74 and no. 77 .
A Letter from the Victim 's Family
First of all , I would like to thank a kind - hearted person for calling the police immediately . I would also like to thank the public security authority for the prompt capture of the perpetrators .
Early in the morning on September 1 , my father , as usual , was riding his bicycle to Gucheng Park for exercise .
At Jiuli Street , he saw someone lying on the side of the road , and so , out of kindness , he went up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon .
Then , three people ran up to him , kicking and beating him
( according to the police , they had drunk four cases of beer at the time ) ,
as a result , my father 's skull suffered serious injury . He bled profusely and lost consciousness . By the time he was taken to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated .
However , with prompt rescue given by a doctor , he survived .
As there was serious bleeding , the doctor performed a life - saving surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father 's head to remove blood clots .
Due to profuse bleeding , some of the blood had already flowed into the brainstem and bottom of the brain , putting his life in danger .
Right now , my father is in very serious condition .
On September 1 , he underwent a 5 - hour craniotomy . On September 2 , he had a tracheotomy , and a respirator was used to help him breathe .
Currently , he is still unconscious .
After these few days of hospital treatment , he is sometimes able to move his arms and feet , and he is showing signs of recovery .
As his children , we feel very terrible now .
It has been six days since the incident . Under the police 's advice , the perpetrators finally gave 10,000 yuan . We have already delivered the money to the hospital .
Now , almost 50,000 yuan has been spent on the medical bills . We do n't know when we can get money to pay for future medical bills .
We have now already received a payment reminder from the hospital .
If we do not pay on time , the hospital will stop supplying medications . When that happens , I cannot bear to think of what will happen to my father .
Our family has very poor living conditions . My mother only gets a minimum welfare pay of 380 yuan , and she has diabetes .
My father is a retired coking plant worker . His pay is also only a bit over 1,000 yuan .
I am doing odd jobs at a factory , and I have not even made any medical insurance or pension contributions .
My elder sister is also an odd - job worker . She has also not made any pension or medical insurance contributions .
Furthermore , I am going to be a father soon . I have a very heavy family burden .
Our family now can only rely on my father 's pay to survive . We absolutely cannot afford such high hospital costs .
It has been six days since the incident . As victims , we have the rights of a citizen to know some things :
1. Where are the perpetrators from ? How are their family and financial conditions ?
2. When can the case be submitted to the procuratorate ? When can public prosecution be initiated ?
3. We hope the perpetrators can cooperate actively and take practical actions to work together to first save my father 's life .
4. We request to meet the parents of the perpetrators .
We hope the news media can help us to jointly save the life of my kind - hearted father .
We also ask the government departments to coordinate with one another and be flexible to activate my father 's medical insurance card and save his life .
After the court verdict is out , all medical costs will be paid back to the medical insurance bureau .
A million thanks to the city residents and media for the concern they have shown us in this incident .
May all you kind - hearted people have a life of peace !
Victim 's son
Latest development
Victim : Old Mr. Yang is currently still unconscious and in critical condition .
The family members of Old Mr. Yang said tearfully that when the old man was being sent to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated . He has been transferred to ICU ( intensive care unit ) after receiving emergency treatment given by the hospital .
The medical costs alone add up to as much as more than 5,000 yuan a day .
Perpetrators : Three men have been criminally detained by Zhenjiang Jingkou police .
After the three of them paid 10,000 yuan in total for the medical costs ,
the family of Ma recently again raised 10,000 yuan to pay for surgery .
Hereby , we hope the perpetrators will be able to show resolution in taking on responsibilities and face seriously the mistake that has been committed .
Victim 's family : As Old Mr. Yang is still in a toxic and unconscious state , he is unable to provide information about what happened at the time of the incident .
Though the three perpetrators have paid 10,000 yuan compensation in total , it is obviously not enough to pay for the current medical costs that are increasing sharply by the day .
Furthermore , in view of the criminal detention time limit , can such punishment have a deterrent effect on the perpetrators ?
How about future medical costs ?
The Yang family hopes to get legal and media assistance .
Associated incidents
The moment this incident came out , this writer could not help but recall the " touch porcelain " case that happened two years ago !
Cases like the one where " a vehicle owner who helped an old lady lying on the ground get up was accused of knocking her down " all raised a huge uproar across town .
Sometimes , I even doubt the frequency at which such incidents happen , life is getting to really look like fiction !
The society always makes you feel painfully scared . Every day , there always seem to be countless reasons that make people curse .
Let 's not say much . Let 's pray for the injured and hope the perpetrators get punished .
The perpetrators are not going to be held responsible just because they said they are poor ! ?
Who dares to be a Samaritan in future ?
The important thing is to save life !
Are there any solutions ? Provide legal assistance !
Let the law show its might ~
It takes 30 days before public prosecution is initiated . Even day lilies wither by then ! ~
This is actually not about being a Samaritan or not . Many drunkards have lost their consciousness and will get in a drunken fit .
When you want to help , you have to see who it is . If you ca n't handle , just call 120. Sigh ...
Severe punishment still should be given to those who commit crimes after drinking . If not , it will be chaos if everyone pretends to be drunk and bashes up others .
Nowadays , one should not do evil , but one should not do good , either
Such a cup .
The old man was looking for trouble . He should have kept a distance after seeing those drunkards .
Would everyone agree with illegal construction of high - rise buildings ?
Now , in the hometown of our beloved General Secretary Hu , such a strange thing is happening .
Here is the thing : Shenzhen Maoye Developer has come to Hailing District , Taizhou City , Jiangsu Province for urban construction , and is welcomed by our people .
We do not oppose the construction of high - rise buildings . However , the developer is going to construct a high - rise building against the law . That is what we are resolutely opposed to !
Maoye Developer has planned a high - rise building of 150 m in the Julangchao lot of the old East Station , Hailing District , Taizhou City .
Julangchao used to be the eastern suburbs park , for which many of the old Taizhou people have great affection .
Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 is just located at the back of the Julangchao lot , and now Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 is only about 100 meters from the external walls of the original buildings at the farthest end of the Julangchao lot .
How does the developer meet the national requirement for building setbacks based on a minimum sunshine spacing of 1:1.4 in Taizhou ?
Aside from the other sunshine shelters , how can the developer ensure a minimum three hours of sunshine on the day of Great Cold ?
It is certainly not feasible if they want to cheat about the 3 hours technically ,
The plain fact is just in front of us . Moreover , are those few entities the only ones capable of doing sunshine analysis in China ?
We certainly will verify it . A lie will never become the truth !
If the developer can not even give us owners a minimum of three hours on the day of Great Cold in accordance with the national requirement , which has ensured its best interests , how can it give a reasonable and fair explanation to the society , the vast community of netizens and the masses ?
Where are the conscience and morals of the developer ?
We understand that the developer wants to get more benefits , but those are supposed to be legitimate benefits !
On the one hand , such act , if illegally infringing upon other people 's interests , will be detrimental to the reputation and long - term future development of the entire Maoye group . On the other hand , are people whose interests are infringed all fools ?
Will they just let the infringement occur ?
The minimum 3 hours is already difficult to accept . If it is basically an illegal act that makes the fundamental three hours even less , think about it - how will things evolve ?
Finally , the contradictions are bound to intensify , making the situation out of hand .
We hope that the developer can seriously think about this issue , avoid losses and seek its own legal interests through rational development and reasonable development according to law !
If the developer are determined to infringe on our rights and interests , we will surely unite as one to defend our legitimate rights and interests !
The most strange thing is that some people of high rank even agree with the illegal construction of high - rise buildings . We hereby earnestly request the people of high rank who agree with the illegal construction of high - rise buildings to raise their hands and give us a way out !
All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in General Secretary Hu 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer !
All netizens are welcome to look into this matter !
Hello , everyone !
Previously , due to issues about the high - rise buildings on Maoye 's pre - sale renderings and EIA by the Taizhou Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau , the young and old of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 were neither sleeping nor eating well . Some were depressed , and some were irritated . In short , we felt very angry .
Now Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau has given us a clear answer that those were simply renderings . Upon verification , the Planning Bureau has requested the developer to make modification . The Bureau will definitely exercise administration according to law , and never approve anything unless it is legal , reasonable and fair ! A forum and a hearing will also be held prior to approval ! A large stone in our hearts has finally dropped onto the ground .
We are moved that in the face of such a huge benefit , our leaders of Taizhou Municipal Government and Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau have stood unswayed , showing a very noble sentiment and reflecting the characteristics of the Communists in serving the people , which is truly admirable !
All owners of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 hereby express deep respect and gratitude to Taizhou Municipal Government and Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau for upholding justice ! People living in Taizhou are happy , thanks to the officials caring for them like their parents !
We thank the government for its concerns over people ! We strongly support for the government administration according to law !

I hope that the developer does not come to compete against us for sunlight . How do we live without sunlight ?
All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in General Secretary Hu 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer ! For us ordinary people who are like dog shit in this society , it is ridiculous to discuss whether power or law is superior .
I feel really good about that oh oh
What 's the point of law over power ?
It is the powerful that make the final execution .
Yeah , in the real world , we vulnerable groups really feel at a loss as to what to do so often . The power of developers is too great ,
Some relevant government departments just blatantly give the green light to developers against the law and help them fool people !
So we have to frequently ask ourselves : is the law enacted by this country really useful ?
Is it really capable of restraining developers from grabbing through deceit or by force and illegally obtaining benefits ?
But we can not just watch as the developer take away our sunlight , leaving children and the elderly shivering at home in cold winter . If so , we ca n't live a healthy life , nor can we enjoy the warmth of the sun !
Japan had been thinking about invading China for a long time . Would it need the assignment from Russia to decide whether to invade China or not ? Not to mention that the US only acts against the political system of China ? Was it still not enough for Russia to be fooled after 1991 ?
The weapons market in South Asia has been dominated by the hairy country . Though it is weakened by the US weapons market , however , the Russian weapons market still occupies the major portion .
It is not Russia deliberately making use of countries on the South China Sea to besiege China .
Looking at the chaos in the East China Sea and the South China Sea , even thinking with your ass , you will also know that it is the US rather than Russia trying to cause trouble .
Firstly , Russia is not a country with sea power . It has no interest in intervening and meddling in the issues of the East and South China Seas .
Secondly , at present , with the expansion and extrusion of NATO , Russia can hardly protect its own traditional zone of influence . We can say it is busy enough with its own affairs .
And presently , the Asia - Pacific Military Cooperation and NATO are all products of the US 's two - ocean strategy .
After World War I , two systems had taken place . One is the Versailles System in Europe and the Atlantic , and the other was the US - Japanese Washington System in the Far East and the Pacific .
The US stretches over the two oceans , and controls the two systems at the same time .
After World War II , it took control of the two systems respectively , castrating Germany in Europe , and Japan staying alone in Asia to be hermaphrodites , living on by helping the US manufacture electronics and automobile products .
And now , the biggest enemies for the US are such large geopolitical powers in the Old World as Russia and China .
While Russia and the West have no so - called estrangement in ideology and political system , NATO still continues to expand to the east .
And now the Asia - Pacific Military Cooperation is setting up a blockage line and a ring of encirclement around the coastal regions in East and South China .
The coup in Central Asia has not succeeded . Otherwise , once the ring of encirclement is completed , the northern land will cause a headache to you just as the East China Sea and the South China Sea .
Do you still believe that China can become a friend of the US as long as it changes its ideology and system ?
The reasons for China to ally with Russia are that both Russia and China need to heal their wounds from after the disintegration of the Soviet Union and with the savage hegemony of the US .
Solving the existing territorial disputes is an important means of realizing mutual trust . Of course China has made great concessions . There is no other choice .
In fact , unlike China , Russia has neither the policy of reform of opening up nor a good future ( this precious opportunity was seized by China at the historical turning point then , while in Russia , it was ruined by the two idiots at the critical moment . It also shows that the Russians are relatively inferior to the Chinese people in terms of both IQ and EQ ) .
The Russians are bare - footed , so they are not afraid of a China with shoes .
China has enough reasons to make concessions to Russia . China has no fear . China has many opportunities and China has other approaches .
Although Russia is not our friend , we should not turn it into an enemy .
Russia and Japan should not be equated with each other .
To the Chinese people , if Russia wantonly killed Chinese people in China 's traditional area of activities like Japan did , then in the sentiments of ordinary Chinese people , they would hate Russia as much as they hate Japan . However , they did not .
The only case where they wantonly killed Chinese people happened at the end of the Tsing Dynasty . It was the disputable Hailanpao Slaughter .
Thousands or tens of thousands , the number is just a small proportion even compared with the population of the Manchu .
It can even be ignored if compared with the Chinese population of nearly 400 million . Can it be equated with Japan 's massacre of Chinese people in the populated North and Southeast of China ?
Besides , Russia is a European country with its strategic focus in the west . The Far East is never its focus .
If the Russians really want to seriously take China as their arch enemy , they should strive to construct the Far East .
However , nowadays , with its own serious problems , it continues to abandon the Far East and many cities have become heaps of ruins .
It shows that Russia 's strategic focus has been in the west , addressing the expansion of NATO . Only traitors will be advocating hostile relations between China and Russia here .
The US can pose a greater threat and impact upon China than Russia , especially in the core area of China .
The reasons are simple . Russia is a European country . The Far East is not its focus , while the US is a country in the Asia - Pacific region .
Do you know the theory of sea control ? Nowadays , is there more influence from the US or Russia in the issues of the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea and the Far East ? It is the US ! This is clear proof !
Do you think that territorial waters are n't territory ? In modern times , the strategic and economic values of territorial waters are much more than those of land territories . One can only become a strong power and have a say in the international community by controlling the sea .
Why was it not China , its neighbor , but instead Great Britain , separated by vast oceans , that made India into a colony ?
Nowadays , Russia has serious problems itself . Its armaments are quite obsolete , and the living conditions for its people are extremely adverse . The population has faced a sharp reduction .
The national elites all know the home country is hopeless , so they all run abroad .
It has become common practice for women to marry foreigners , and many of them come to China and become prostitutes .
Even the productivity of the population is seriously lacking . It is impossible for it to constitute a threat to China .
And nowadays the US is besieging and containing China openly with a view of disrupting China .
Why leave the current problems unsolved , but seize on Russia , which has no ability to pose a threat to China at present ?
When it comes to that Russia occupied China 's territory , that is another story like the Japanese did . Japan wanted to invade the whole country of China , but can Russia do that ?
Russia is a European country with its strategic focus on the west , rather than the Far East . Its expansion to the Far East in history was also partly non - governmental and partly governmental .
Japan is separated from China only by a strait , with the spacious Pacific behind it . There is no menace from the rear if it invades China with all its strength . Can Russia do that ?
Even if Russia puts a little bit more energy into the issues of China and the Far East , can it ignore the affairs in Europe ?
Moreover , we would rather say that Russia has availed itself of opportunities , than to say that it had invaded and occupied China 's territories .
At that time , those places were far away from China 's traditional living area . China 's exploration was a little bit later at that time . There have been few inhabitants around those places in history .
At that time , those places were bitterly cold places covered with waist - deep snows . So we pay no heed to them .
Although when it comes to now , these places are of great economic and strategic importance . However , at that time we did n't discover that ; therefore , at that time even the ruler of China paid no heed to the places , and sent no immigrants there for quite a long time .
Just like today 's oceans . From the perspective of today , they have huge economic values , so territorial waters are also important territories .
However , in the past , they were not discovered . And territorial waters were not regarded as territories . They even exercised trade prohibition on the sea area and closed the coastlines .
Yet the Russians availed themselves of a favorable geological location to occupy those places ahead of us . The Russians were just availing themselves of opportunities .
At that time , it was a time when big powers established colonies everywhere . Unlike today , when the behavior of all countries are bound by international laws .
Other big powers had to capture colonies by war . For example , it was through war that Britain and Japan occupied Hong Kong and Taiwan respectively .
However , the Russians got such a big place without much effort . That was because the ruler of China did n't care for the unexplored places .
They just availed themselves of opportunities . Things such as territory are hard to talk about .
If it was your imminent area of activity , it might be justifiable .
However , if it was a place that you did n't send immigrants to explore for a long period throughout history , and was taken by others because of a favorable geographical location and convenient access , then as time goes by it would be hard to say , after a certain length of time .
It would be barely passable for you to claim it to be yours . This is totally different from Japan . Can Russia launch a barbaric war of aggression to occupy China 's imminent territories like Japan did ?
Can it provoke * to invade northeast China and launch an all - out war of aggression against China because northeast China had become an imminent territory of China like northern China with the arrival and exploration of large number of immigrants from inside Shanhaiguan Pass ? It is impossible .
The opinions of the writer Wuhan Tuo La Ji Shou on the upper floor are brilliant ! However , by reversing the order of " subjugation of the nation " and " elimination of the entire race , " would it be in line with the historical facts ?
Right now Russia is clamoring " to build India into the top military power in Asia . " Putin personally sealed the arms sale deal to sell India advanced weapons such as aircraft carriers , nuclear - powered submarines , T 50 fighters and BrahMos missiles ... Even the weapons it sells to Vietnam are more advanced than those it sells to China . And it only sells China big airplanes and carrier aircraft . Its wild ambitions are thoroughly exposed !
It is a pity that the present dynasty are national scum supported by the Soviet Union ! While the yellow Russians are prevailing , what else can the grass - root folks do ?
It seems that all Chinese hate Japanese , and I am not an exception . However , has everybody thought it over that it was Russia who stirred up the war between China and Japan for fear that China would reclaim territories from it ? It was also Russia that went between the Communist Party and the KMT and was able to achieve success one way or the other . And at the end of the war of resistance , it then stirred up the civil war , and lured China to get involved in the Korean War . If Stalin was still alive , China would have more trouble !
Even if it has propped up an agent in China , it is still concerned about China . And in the 21st century , it continues to play little tricks of provoking anti - Chinese sentiments . It sold weapons to Vietnam and checked and seized the cargos of Chinese merchants . Its crimes are so numerous that bamboo strips would be exhausted before they could all be recorded .
What is regretful is that our government deals with such kind of things in different ways . If the US or Japan does so , Mr. Qin Gang and Ms. Jiangyu would absolutely deliver a so - called just and severe statement of condemnation . Yet with regard to the incident of the Chinese boatmen who were shot by Russia , there was not even a protest presented . And it became an incident with no definite results in the year 2009 .
The greatest threat of subjugation of the nation comes from Russia . In history , countries being eliminated by this nation were as many as the stars in the sky . Moreover , in the history of China , almost all geographical threats came from the north .
The greatest threat of " elimination of the entire race " comes from Japan . The seed of national hatred is indelible . Once discharged accidentally , it would not be just territorial conflicts , but a massacre .
The greatest threat of downfall of D comes from the US . The dramatic contrast of ideology causes the US to treat all dictating Ds in the world as targets to be removed .
However , there is no need to worry that he would have any claims for territory .
The greatest threat to the economy comes from the EU . The EU frequently takes the opportunity of trade or human right conflicts between China and the US to grab a large portion of the market , and squeezes the surplus values . Now it has become our biggest trading partner .
Personally I think the geopolitical environment of China is quite adverse . However , Just as what the floor host said , the real threat comes from Russia .

Do you think nowadays that Russia still has the capacity to do that ?
If the Communist Party of China does not put the practical interests of the people first , but continues to tolerate the corrupt governments , the people would lose their faith in the Party , and in the near future it could hardly be avoided that the territories of China would be divided by an alliance of the US and Russia !
It was foreseeable that they have put their hands into our neighboring countries , and they have instigated pressures on our country from all sides . Has n't the government in power run by the Communist Party been claiming to be strong ? And now it is time for you to bring your wisdom into play ~
The Sino - Japanese war and the civil war of China were stirred up by Russia , and Russia has the ability to force China to send troops to North Korea ? Nonsense !
For China , China and United States have the biggest relationship in the world , and the Sino - US relationship is a trade - off relationship .
In the most recent visit to the US by Xi Jinping , which is an exercise before he becomes the top official in China , the primary topic discussed was mutually beneficial economic cooperation of the two sides .
The Sino - US relationship is very complicated . Economically , the two sides are partners on unequal footings ,
politically , it is a relationship between socialism and capitalism ; militarily , Chinese and US militaries are in an isolated state .
Therefore , currently China is playing games with the United States , i.e. how to offset the latter two relationships with economic cooperation .
Next is a brief analysis of the main strategy of Xi Jinping 's visit to the US :
First , what is the biggest puzzle between China and the US ?
The biggest puzzle in front of China is how to maintain its relationship with the US as it becomes increasingly powerful .
To China , it cannot fall out with the US .
If China falls out with the US , then it will seriously consumes China 's strengths and will be very unfavorable for future development of China ,
because China will lose the situation of peaceful development internationally , such that China has to cope with not only the powerful military threat posed by the US , but also complicated relations in the neighboring areas . This will seriously consume China energy for development .
Therefore , on the premise of not falling out with the US , China , on the one hand , still has to maintain relationship with the US , while on the other hand , it has to precaution against the dirty tricks that the US plays on China .
Second , it is not time yet to be tough to the US .
Some believe that China should be tough to the US . Is the US someone that yields to hawkishness ?
In the Soviet Union era , it got in a race for hegemony against the US , where both sides were so tough that they became enemies , which provided the US the opportunity to break up thoroughly with the Soviet Union .
As the US does not need the USSR to exist as a great power , the US could attack the USSR and tackle the USSR without any hesitation .
The road China is going along at present is one where the two sides are intertwined with each other , such that the US also suffers great loss when attacking and imposing sanctions on China .
What 's more , many businesspeople in the US also come out to oppose the government 's behaviors . China will be able to truly rise as long as it can keep on for ten years .
As the ancient saying goes , a gentleman can afford to wait for as long as ten years to avenge . If China falls out with the US too early , it will put itself in a very disadvantaged position .
Although we are strong today , it 's not time yet to fight the final battle with the US .
Third , the two phases that the Sino - US relationship will go through .
It is not advisable to fight a major war in the China 's dealings with the US .
The author believes the two sides could only undergo two phases . The first one is a period which sees China grow in strength and the US feel seriously threatened .
The second stage is when China has become strong , the US is no longer certain about winning a war with China , such that it has no choice than to cooperate in order to obtain more benefits .
To avoid war between China and the US , it appears extremely important to carry out exchanges between the two peoples .
Next let 's have a look at survey results of Americans view towards China :
An opinion poll of a US website shows that 6 % of the people believe China and the US are " allies , " 69 % think they are " friendly but not allies , " and 4 % believe they are " enemies . "
Survey results also show that 71 % of the Americans believe Sino - US relations are " very important or somewhat important , " while the proportion is 85 % in opinion leaders .
On the 14th , the Washington Post said that in an opinion poll it conducted jointly with the American Broadcasting Company , 52 % of the respondents saw China in a negative way .
This result reflects two urgent issues . First , China is not that bad in the mind of American people , and there is still environment and scope to continue expanding exchanges .
Second , if China and the US do not handle their relations properly , lacking in communications between its peoples and the foundation or friendship , then the Chinese and American peoples may turn hostile .
Therefore , the Chinese and American peoples must enhance cooperation and bring the two sides closer through economic cooperation , so as to offset the discrepancies brought by military and politics .
However , it is undeniable that serious conflicts remain between China and the US in some important areas .
For instance : the Taiwan issue ; human rights and democracy ; North Korea ; Iran ; proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; Pakistan ; geopolitics and military strategy ; trade and currency ; intellectual property rights and internet spies .
These puzzles cannot be overcome with the two characters of friendship alone . After all it involves major interests .
So it is no secret to the two sides . Just like Vice President Xi Jinping counts on the US to oppose Taiwan independence and Tibetan , how could China count on a geopolitical enemy ?
National presidents are all masters in politics , who know what 's at stake . However , what should be said should be said . The thing is if the US has said something , it will break its words if it does n't do what it said , which will show to people in the world that the US is immoral and its words do n't count .
Anyway , between China and the US in the future , whoever is a better strategist and whoever comes up with more sophisticated strategy wins .
It requires wisdom to be friends with an enemy . You can only fight a hundred wars without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .
This view tells us a fact that one will earn respect by developing military force
The cannons are thicker
It requires wisdom to be friends with an enemy . You can only fight a hundred wars without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .
Chairman Mao has said a long time ago : one will be beaten if he / she is backward . Only development is of overriding importance !
It is fun ? They are ordering the dog they feed at home to bark at you , yet you have gone to shake hands with them , looking for slaps

Brainwash the Chinese people on behalf of the Americans .
Brainwash the Chinese people on behalf of the Americans .
Is it the American system that 's superior or the Chinese system that 's superior after all ?
I think Taiwan and the mainland are already distinguishing relative superiority or inferiority between them . The thread starter should take a look outside the country more
You look but not see the ZG 's chaos in society , or is it voluntary blindness !
I also feel that there are more modern " traitors of China " than during WWII .
Everyone has eyes , look at the living situations of North Korea and South Korea - do you still not understand ?
Venture exchange ,
If I take care of myself , that 's good enough , when the country needs me , I 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness
If these traitors of China existed around 50 , 60 years ago , they would already have been executed by firing squad .
To make a conclusion , you must have something to demonstrate it
I do n't have time to go searching
I wish LZ would explain them one by one ...
Their property and families are all outside of the country , of course they will , just like the officials .
when the country needs me , I 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness
I can just take a look , and dare not to speak my mind , the police can grab people , thread starter , I admire you for daring to speak ! Bump !
The ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators and traitors of China !
Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said that the Communist Party will not be overthrown - if it falls , it will be brought down from within the party itself .
Former US Ambassador to China Mr. Huntsman once said in a speech in the US : we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in China , let the Chinese themselves topple China -
and the CIA then used an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so - called elite , vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically , citizens definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsiders use us .
He ca n't seem to help himself from apologizing for anything and everything .
Hallmark could make a fortune off of this guy .
I do n't follow , why should he apologize to Palin ?
Did Palin apologize to Giffords ?
He needs to conduct a beer summit between Palin and NBC .
Mend some fences and get this country moving .
He could call it the APOLOGIES ON BEER tour .
Hell , sell tickets and hire the Chinese to cater the event .
Who Drops Out After Super Tuesday ?
I think Romney wins big today and obviously stays in .
Santorum gets enough of a boost to do the Huckabee hangs around .
I think Gingrich 's sole win in GA is enough to hang it up and go back to making millions in the private sector .
I think the Good Doctor is too crazy to hang it up .
I will stick around until the end .
No one
I think Mitt drops out ...
Ok , my answer is no one and Obama wins the GE .
The only one with any reason to will be Newt , but I do n't think that he will .
Ron Paul says tornado victims should not get aid
Nuts .
My heart goes out to the people in tornado alley and I have no problem with my tax dollars going to help the survivors rebuild their lives .
If you have no problem with your tax dollars going to aid them then you 'd have no problem donating to them of your own free will .
Not to mention that he 's absolutely right that they should have insurance to cover them .
Ron Paul is not quite bright .
He 's right in some ways but it does n't translate into being right across the board .
This is n't like someone 's house burning down and they make an insurance claim .
Everything is gone , the entire infrastructure is gone .
Even if someone has insurance to cover their loss , that wo n't extend to the roads , power lines , sewers , public buildings .
The problem with this regime is aid is not distributed equally .
Democrats get it , minorities get it , white republican jurisdictions do n't .
Aid is now patronage , good party members get it .
Is n't it interesting how Libertarians ' desire for " freedom " correspond so neatly with skinflints who do n't want to give ANYONE , ANYTHING .
So while libertarianism attracts people who want to be " free " it also attracts cheap assholes who do n't want to pay their fair share .
Perhaps when Libertarians figure out a way to differentiate between the two , I 'll vote for them .
I get what Ron Paul is saying .
Thats what a Hardcore Libertarian would say .
But the rest of us are thinking about the people that do not have insurance and / or need help right now .
Kind of hard to build a house over night , Mr Paul .
Kind of hard to import food considering that the stores are probably wiped out too .
How does one survive until the insurance ( hopefully by a respectable company ) claim comes through ?
How does one survive when you have the funds but the people you need to buy the goods from has no address ?
I know , you get into your pickup and drive over to the next town -- if you can find your damn pickup !!
Homeowners generally have insurance , but Federal Aid is necessary to provide for the clean up , repairs of electrical and water systems , roads , schools , buses , etc. etc.
Keep in mind insurance companies are not in the business of paying claims , they are in the business of making money .
Anyone who suffers a loss as have those who lost everything over the weekend will not be made whole , and whatever claim they receive will not come soon or easy .
Ron Paul and his Libertarian ideas are at best impractical .
No surprise there .
He had to win there to stay in , so ultimately this helps Mitt keep the vote split .
Best outcome of the night would have been Newt losing there .
He 's a nonfactor at this point and only in out of spite .
If he were out of the race , Santorum might have had a chance .
The Catholic Church is opposed to contraception for moral reasons .
Where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities ?
Where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent ?
Where is the morality when disease is spread ?
Where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence ?
When a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control ?
I am with you .
If you cant feed , house and take care of a baby you have no business having one .
Why is it literally 100 % impossible for the liberal mind to understand that just because you do n't want government involved in something does n't mean you 're against it ?
I 'm in favor of feeding , clothing , and giving shelter to the poor . I 'm against all the gov't institutions that tax our brains out and who inefficiently attempt to provide some of these things .
Now am I just a genius who does n't know it , or is it really not THAT hard to understand such a simple concept ?
Will they try to prop Romney up with a strong VP to help make him more palatable - or will they bring in a new face ?
Either way , they 've got a big problem .
Are n't you one of the assholes who assured us how Romney was inevitable as the GOP nominee ?
I do n't think Standtorum will tank , its going to be a close one till the very end , I am still rooting for a Romney / McDonnell ticket .
Wow , another Solyndra - type company who took our money and failed in their goal .
They laid off 125 employees , but gave big raises to executives .
Another scam that the media will ignore .
After seeing those bus tours to AIG execs homes , promoted on ACORN 's website , I am wondering why those same people are n't outraged at this .
Maybe because it would look bad for the guy who promises to pay their mortgages , put gas in their tanks , gave them free cell phones and increased the welfare rolls .
Of course , the people on the AIG bus tours likely did n't get soaked with high taxes to pay for this scam , so why should they care ?
This is not surprising or shocking to me .
Obama must pay off his supporters by way of cash infusions and call it " stimulus " money .
He is not lying to call it stimulus .
It stimulates others to be big contributors so they may be in on the next wave of free cash from the boy king .
Another victory for the left because there are more people in need .
The government will rush in and show these people that government dependency is better than working and providing for themselves .
That is the plan with all the liberal policies .
No one should be expected to practice self sufficiency or concern themselves with personal responsibility .
Increase the welfare rolls till the takers outweigh the givers . Only then can socialism creep in .
Everything Obama has done is straight from Alinsky 's Rules for Radicals . All of it .
If some on the left want to remain ignorant and not read Alinky 's book to prove it , that is on them .
For those in the know , this was all quite predicable .
Dumb , dumb dumb ...
I 've always been a critic of judges who decide they are going to disregard the will of legistlatures and the populace and impose these things , but here 's a case where they did it the right way ,
they passed a bill , and Christie the Hutt decides he 's stull sucking up to be RomBot 's running mate .
Christie is being set up on this one and the legislature called his bluff
It will make him a big shot with the GOP in 2012 but by 2016 if he were to run for president " Christie vetoed gay marriage " will be a millstone around his neck .
By 2016 most Americans will have gay marriage available .
Christies denial of marriage privleges to gays will alienate independents and his " I wanted to have the people vote on it " will ring hollow
It is Santorum that is the by far major nonRomney candidate and Newt would appear to be the spoiler .
When the situation was reversed Gingrich argued that Santorum was helping Romney get the nomination and for the good of the conservative cause Santorum should drop out .
Now that the same logic would apply to Gingrich dropping out , should he ?
Sure , why not .
I think Santorum is going to be the last of the " Not Romneys " , and Newt has had his moment .
Who know . He may make a comeback .
Of course money is a problem for him so he may HAVE to drop out .
Santorum or Mitt . I could vote for either one .
No , why should he ?
He is , if nothing else , insuring that he 'll be able to sell books after the election .
I mean you do n't really think that any of these guys really give a shit about their party or their nation , do ya ?
More than they care about themselves , I mean .
Americans ' assessment of Congress has hit a new low , with 13 % saying they approve of the way Congress is handling its job .
The 83 % disapproval rating is also the worst Gallup has measured in more than 30 years of tracking Congressional Job Performance .
Ever notice that the more gridlock there is , the more Congress ' ratings go down .
In other words , Congress should stop all the politcal bickering , put their heads together and start working things out in a real bi - partisan format .
It worked for Reagan and Clinton and look at the positive results .
I 'm not the least bit surprised .
I 'm still waiting for Pelosi to drain the damned swamp .
Today on the Senate floor Durbin said healthcare premiums WILL NOT GO DOWN and that the Administration needs to quit saying that !!!!
Then Nancy Pelosi in the House said we need to pass the Healthcare Bill so " we can find out what 's in it ..... "
The Democrats are slowy turning Congress into Bozo 's Bigtop Circus !!!!!
The insurance industry 's own institute said premiums would skyrocket .
How could they not ?
If you force them to accept pre - existing conditions and accept other insured 's currently not eligible because they cost too much , who is going to pay for that extra risk ?
You ca n't legislate risk away . Of course premiums will rise .
The administration is in campaign mode , willing to say or do anything to get this turd passed .
The joke will be on House Dems who are being promised a bill to " fix " the problems with teh Senate bill .
Anyone who believes that will happen is dreaming .
Obama will hang them out to dry .
1. Ending the war in Iraq
2. Developing American energy independence
3. Universal healthcare for all Americans
Works for me ......
Only if that means it is over because we won .
And we will have some very strategically located , large bases to counter Iranian and Russian agression for the next 50 years .
A good thing , but he will have to include things he opposes , like DRILLING and NUCLEAR power , along with coal power to get there .
Only if he adopts Hillary 's plan of MANDATORY UNIVERSAL PARTICIPATION .
Which means EVERYONE , without exception , PAYS premiums .
Here are the things that should be Obama 's top priorities .
#1 Ending the war in Iraq
#2 Bringing us Universal Healthcare
#3 Repealing NAFTA
#4 Repealing The Patriot Act
#5 Repealing Taft - Hartley
#6 Bringing Bush / Cheney up on criminal charges for war crimes . ( send them to the Haig ! ! ! )
#7 Fire John Bolton !
#8 Strengthen the FISA act
#9 Abolish The Office Of Homeland Security !
#10 Prosecute John Ashcroft !
what about when my favorite doctor quits because he is not going to take a pay cut ?
or just lets the quality of his practice go down the tubes ?
also , who is going to goto school for 15 years to be a doctor , with major student loans and only make a sub - par government salary ?
i 'll tell ya what , if were going to goto school for 15 years , it would be for rocket science or computer engineering or something of that nature so i could easily make an above average salary .
last and most importantly , i never want to see any of my paycheck support some lazy person who does not work because the government pays for them to live their life .
I plan on voting against every single one of these dirtbags that call themselves representatives .
Our congress , be it the house or senate , are a bunch of non - representing representatives .
Its as if the British Red Coats were in charge once again doing whatever is best for themselves irregardless of the consitution .
I say kick them all out of office , and then do it again every election for the next several cycles until they get the hint .
WE ARE NOT HAPPY , WE ARE NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE !!!!
Am I the only one or are some of you feeling like this too ?
I 'm not a Republican , I 'm not a democrat , I AM AN AMERICAN !!!!!
Start respecting my country , my consitution , and our national heritage or get fired / voted out .
Add your 2 cents people .
I 'll have a Senator to vote for along with my Representative , and Senator Voinovich is not running in 2010 so I 'll luckily have more options to vote for .
So far there are 3 candidates in the race that I 'm aware of , and I 'm not impressed by any of them .
But hopefully somebody good pops up that I can support .
As far as my Representative goes , I ca n't wait to vote against him .
I do n't vote ' against ' anyone .
I vote ' for ' the best candidate for the job , regardless of political affiliation ( unless , of course , they are un - American , like Libtards and Neocons ) .
Since none of the incumbents in my district will get my vote , I guess you could say I 'm voting ' against ' them , but I 'm still not comfortable with that term .
Where would McCain be without Sarah ?
A lot of us , including myself , have had fun poking , jabbing , making fun of Palin , her lack of knowledge about the Constitution , her appearance on SNL , etc. ...
but at this late date in the race ...
Where would he , ( McCain ) , be if he did not have her as his running mate
IMO .... she is helping him more now , because he is hurting himself , more .
Palin solidified the Republican base for McCain .
She invigorated the far right wingers to actually go out and campaign for McCain , instead of apathetically voting for McCain to spite Obama .
Palin is the real star behind the Republican ticket this year .
If it were anyone else , McCain would not have a shot in hell .
Palin invigorated Obama 's campaign , and she is one of the reasons Obama raised $ 150 million dollars in September .
When I saw her speech at the convention , I immediately sent Obama as much money as I could .
Presidential Candidates : Chuck Baldwin ( C ) Constitution Party Bob Barr ( L ) Libertarian McCain ( R ) Cynthia McKinney ( G ) Green Ralph Nader ( I ) Independent Obama ( D )
Looks like women have a candidate running for President .
Why are n't women flocking to her ?
What 's wrong with the Green party ?
The woman is a nutjob .
She would make Ralph Nader look like Barack Obama .
Why on earth would women vote for the Green Party just because they have a female candidate ?
Sorry , I would n't have voted for Hillary , either .
I would vote for Sarah or Condy .
THe Green Party is the party for the libtards who are too crazy even for other libtards .
If the Government provides Health Care , whether spelled out in this bill or not , it will RATION the care .
That is how it works .
The Government can not afford to pay for everything for everyone , even if they took all our money .
And in fact the research that backs up this health care bill out of the House spells it out clearly .
Specifically it identifies the elderly and those under the age of 2 as being less important and so they will be the first to suffer from reduced services .
Knowing that the Government can not efficiently run anything , I can promise it wo n't end there .
Since all healthcare is rationed , the question for me is do I want those decisions to rest with corporations whose sole reason for existence is to make a profit --- profits which depend upon insuring the healthiest among us , and denying coverage for those whom they may have to pay claims ?
Corporations where profits are dependent on NOT providing the services I pay for ?
That can at any point in time decide to cancel my policy , leaving me without any coverage at all and no prospects of obtaining coverage on my own ?
That spend 1/3 of their revenue in administrative overhead ?
I have not seen much cold weather , or snow , here in the northeast .
Meterologist say this will be a warmer than usual winter this year .
Many temperatures have been above what is normal for this time of year .
Is this Winter weather going to be what winters will be like in the future . ?
Warmer temperatures . ?
Is what global warming is about . ?
Hey stupid , Maine 's getting 4-8 inches of snow tonight .
When it snowed in October it was Global Warming too
52nd Street all up in the white .
I see mr. Biker boys . Thanks for letting me know .
Whats the name of that motor cycle gang you belong to ??
Its warmer , therefore Global Warming
It 's snowing , therefore Global Warming
When will it be too late to do anything about global warming ?
Have we already guaranteed our doom ?
So you are a warmist too ehh ?
Sorry to hear .
The facts .... from about 1980 to 1998 we had a 1/3 of a degree warming period .
This started the Man made global warming claim .
Another inconvenient fact for the man made global warming crowd . Since 1998 until today there has been no significant warming .
A further fact . In the early 1900 's scientists predicted that over the next 100 years the temperature would go up globally about 1 degree . And that is what it did .
So we had an 18 year trend that saw a rise of 1/3 of a degree world wide . Followed to date by a 14 year period with no appreciable warming . Remind me again how we are all doomed ?
Experiencing the great platonic year .
Precission of the earths equinox refers to the earth 's axis wobble moving in an unconventional way .
Time period event is a 25765 yrs wobble path .
Notice the ice cap weight shifting it is due to earths own inertia and the sun moon alignment .
This vid indicates inertia shifts in ice not to be due to global warming but due to physics of the earth , sun , moon system .
This inertia of the sun earth moon generates potential physical plate movements on earth , ie earthquakes .
Very cool stuff .
So is this because of global warming or is it Bush 's fault ?
It 's a good thing the polar ice cap is shrinking then right ?
This seems to explain the record snow fall in Siberia and Alaska .
Nobody as yet really understands why periodically earth undergoes geomagnetic reversal . But the wandering magnetic pole seems to have been happening for the last 200 million years .
Happens regularly , and seems to have little effect on the biosphere as a whole .
No unusual events in the paleo record seem to be associated with magnetic reversals .
but everyone knows that what man makes doesnt count huh ?
Not , I suspect , as it relates to magnetic pole shift or drift .
You just know that some ignorant fool is going to blame pollution .
This is really eye opening .
Where are the environmentalists ?
Have you seen the trash along the roads and in the ditches across this county ?
I see chairs couches refrigerators and who knows what else out here in the countryside .
People have no respect for their neighbors and I am talking about Americans here .
If they have no respect for their neighbors or fellow countrymen how can they have respect for themselves ?
Its not everybody but a small segment of our society but the question is how small is this segment ?
Now that is precisely what I am referring to .
Instead of focusing on the filthy habits of illegals violating our border , you go one a mission to deflect .
Not today , pal .
Stay on point !
Whole apartment was shaking .
Far out and funky !
What the hell ?
Two Thumbs said he felt this too in PA.
Nothing here in Birmingham though .
did you think earthquake at first ?
Felt it here just outside of Reading , PA !
Thought I was having a seizure or something at first , till I saw the water in my water bottle swaying back and forth .
The book shelf in my computer room was moving back and forth .
Weird dude .
Was going on for like 20 seconds .
The time of water wars is upon us with the privatization of water resources worldwide by multinational conglomerates who are not accountable to , or suppressible by the local populations they effect , even here in America .
What say you ?
' Flow , ' a documentary on what the privatization of water really means which was the inspiration for me creating this thread .
It brings to light the insane and completely immoral behavior of water corporations ( Nestle , Coke , Pepsi , as well as Suez and Vivendi , and their involvement with the World Bank ) ...
I am never going to buy another Coke , Pepsi , or Nestle product until ...
I am dying of thirst , which is the situation many in the world find themselves in now .
Allowing the privatization of public waters sources is stupid beyond all understanding .
Water is resource of the commonweal and ought never to be allowed to become captured by any private concern .
Right now corporations like Nestles are buying up the world 's best springs to make bottled water .
Allowing this to happen is a perfect example of how perverted our governments have become .
Hey ........ 30 years ago , I was reading about all kinds of hysterical doomsday theories of the extinction of this natural resource or that natural resource .
You get a few decades down the line and realize there are lots of smart people out there who roll out hysterical theories because they know there are millions of suckers out there who 'll buy it in a heartbeat and profit handsomely FTW !!!
My wife works with the GAO a lot and she sent this report over to me .
They report on just how difficult it will be to regulate the amount of CO 2 being released .
http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10818.pdf
Of course it will be difficult .
The energy companies are putting many , many tens of millions of dollars into preventing anything at all from being done .
But we will probably start doing it well after it will make no differance .
Our grandchildren will curse the blindness and greed of this generation .
I went to youtube and checked out the Gulf oil crisis : all of the posts are one month old , or older ...
How many million people post on youtube ?
The first two months there were hundreds of private citizens with their video cams reporting about what was happening in the gulf ... showing everyone firsthand eyewitness accounts of the incompetence of BP and the lack of government response .
Now there are none : zero : nobody has posted one single video on youtube about the gulf oil crisi for one month .
This stinks to high heaven .
Do n't tell me nobody has posted anything on the gulf crisis for one month : there is a media bl ; ackouit going on .
The last time something like this happened that I know of ; was the republican convention in New York for the renomination of Bush Jr for a second term in office .
Would n't that be a YOUTUBE blackout , then ?
I mean , rather than a MEDIA blackout ?
gulf oil spill - Google Search = Plenty of coverage about the oil spill still on the media .
That 's the point : the oil has not been cleaned up : its sunk below the surface : just like all the true facts have sunk out of sight .
The dispersant they used , Corexit ; has destroyed all possibility of cleaning up the oil because it 's made the oil sunk below the surface .
BP 's use of corexit is a quick way of sweeping the problem under the carpet : idiots who do n't see the oil on the surface will assume that there is n't any ecological damage going on .
Instead , the ecological damage to the entire area is now a million times worse than it was when the oil was still on the surface .
The oil beneath the surface : millions and millions of gallons of oil is killing all wildlife , all the fish , all the dolphins , all the crabs , all the shrimp , everything .
To people who do n't live there : the horror of this catastrophe made worse by BP cannot be understated enough .
Yes you read that correctly .... lets just assign a number because we want too !
Yeah that 's the ticket !
These clowns commit this fraudulent behavior all the fricking time and old fraud , chris , konradv , trolling blunder and a whole host of others ignore this .
What is so distorted in their fundamental makeup that they can see this desecration of science and ignore it ?
He is a fraud in that department .
To find out all we have to do is ask Bernie Sanders and remember that Obama voted to the left of Sanders while in the Senate .
God help us all if Obama ever got to appoint a liberal inflationist Fed Chairman .
Oh , and we might remember that when their God , Keynes , was asked about the future consequencs of his ultra easy monetary policies he said , do n't worry about the future , we 'll all be dead .
Bernie Sanders : Another very important issue is with unemployment so high , how can we strengthen the Fed 's full - employment mandate [ with inflation ] and ensure that it conducts monetary policy to achieve maximum employment ? [ through inflation ] .
In other words the Fed has a number of mandates and one of them is to control inflation .
But one of them also is to pursue policies that lead to full employment .
Is the Fed doing that in an adequate way ?
Well I would argue that by definition when you have 16 % of people unemployed and underemployed it really is not .
They 'd do exactly what they 've done since 1913 .
Lend out " money " that does n't exist , charge interest for it , inflate the hell out of the currency and line their pockets in the process .
Then , they 'd bankroll endless stupid foreign wars , the socialistic welfare state , massive Ponzi schemes , endless bailouts of states , cities , corporations and foreign nations ....
The same thing a conservative Fed would do , and then they 'd call it brilliant and give obama the credit .
An NGDP target can fix the unemployment problem without resulting in inflation .
That 's a gross misunderstanding of the Keynes quote .
What he 's saying is n't , obviously , that we should n't care about the long run .
What he 's saying is that economists are taking the easy way out only ever considering the long run .
We need not only theories of the long run , but also theories of the short run .
Nobody can " fix the unemployment problem " ....
This is the fatal conceit of socialistic central planners coming out of the chute .
" Global warming is real - it is man - made and it is an important problem . But it is not the end of the world . " - who said it ?
Bjørn Lomborg - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia
i think this issue is only valuable for the purposes of supporting commoditization of CO 2. that 's my explanation for why all of the funded scientists point to the gas and build the anthro argument . i dont see how it is credible in light of more dominant causes .
I 'm curious Dante ... Dose n't the temp change by about 40 degrees , every year , in the northern and southern hemisphere ? Also , with warmer temps and more co2 in the atmosphere , would n't the number and variety of plants and trees increase ? What ever happened to the rain forest , nuclear meltdown , ozone layer , global cooling , or any of the other iminent catastrophes that will befall us if we do n't do something RIGHT NOW ! ! ? The only environmental issue important to envronmentalists is whatever one can generate the most money . At least oil companies get their cash by providing us with something we need . You enviro - whackos get yours by doing absolutely nothing at all , except making life harder for everyone else .
In reality humans contribute about 5 % to global worming in terms of CO 2 release into the atmosphere . Yes it is true that we are responsible for this number and trying to minimize it in whatever way we can , but humans are not ultimately the source of global worming . It is arrogant of us to think that we can effect the ecosystem of the world in such a drastic way in only 20 years . Science is divided on the issues with scientists in government labs reporting that global warming is an imminent threat caused by humans and only we can save the planet while scientists at universities and private organizations generally suggest that man is not the ultimate cause and in reality contributes little . The IPCC has published documentation and recommendations about global warming at regular intervals and it was not until one of their more recent publications that they completely overturned their previous data showing global warming to be natural in favor of new data that showed global warming to be human caused . The problem is that they used the same relative data set and simply changed the way it is viewed to maximize the human contribution . They have also been known to falsify information to suit their purposes and destroy information that proves them incorrect .
So it would appear that politics drives natural history and our relation to the ecosystem ... inherent problems there .
Consider too Rapid Climate Change Events as documented by paleoclimatological data from ice cores drilled out of Antarctica and atmospheric analysis of gas frozen in the ice . This heating process occurs every 22,000 years like clockwork for the past 150,000 years that our records go back . Guess what ... it has been just about 22,000 years ... fancy that .
Remember in the 80s when the next ice age was around the corner and we were all going to freeze to death ?
Very simple . Adapting to a rapidly changing climate is preferable to changing our present habits , no matter how destructive they are to the coming generations , or to the rest of the biosphere .
For most people , the present rapid changes are already stretching their abilities to adapt . They see jobs that they considered safe niches now gone forever , with no demand for skills that took years to develop , and now the scientists are telling them that they have to change even more . That we should cease to use fossil fuels asap , that we need to switch to an energy base that features nuclear , wind , solar , geothermal , and other non - polluting sources , that they do not understand , and have no experiance with .
I see otherwise intelligent people convincing themselves of the scientific equivelant of the sun rising in the West simply because they wish to avoid any more changes in the lives , and the way that they live . Which , of course , pushes the changes onto their children , and grandchildren , who will be facing a much more serious situation concerning the effects of a changing climate , a rapidly changing climate , than we face today .
Well , that is the culture of this nation , and our children will suffer the consequences of our inability to face reality .
How long would we live if we could replace body parts with exact matches ?
How about replacing our whole bodies and exchanging brains with that of a clone ?
Someday the micro surgery techiques will be available .
Would you participate ?
I would if it was sure fire .
They are patenting human genes right now .
Perhaps one has an inalienable right to patent ones own body and its specific type .
Do we own our own uniqueness ?
Your thoughts ?
interesting book ... last child in the woods ... talk about how this generation has accepted the merging of man / machine / animals .... that there are about 2000 patented life forms ...
i am not real sure what that means but i am sure xox can explain it ...
i find the idea of " cloning " sillie ...
the so called " clone " is a human from your cells ... not a spare parts factory for you .
are there not still questions concerning the aging of cells in the " clone " animal or person ...
that dollie 's lambs ( remember the sheep that was cloned ) age faster due to her age at the beginning ....
so you would have to clone your infant ...
now tell me .... you have spare infant identical to the one you gave birth too and your not gonna love it ....
now that would be a brave new world .
Would I be able to order clones of Elisha Cuthbert and Jessica Alba that I could keep as sex slaves ?
If so , count me in .
Go ahead and slap a property tax on them too , I 'm good for it .
31 US troops were killed when the Chinook carrying them crashed .
May they rest in peace and condolences to the families and loved ones of these brave young men .
365 Coalition Troops killed this year ? Man , that 's a lot .
I did n't realize the casualties were that high this year .
Our MSM does n't seem very interested in covering the Afghan War much . I 'm really not sure why .
That 's bad but this is the unnecessary war Bush started .
This is war and people die in wars .
Over One Million Iraqi Deaths Caused by US Occupation
This happened in 2010 .
They are the first and only ones , I believe .
They did the same training , made it through .
That is pretty cool .
It 's like the " softest " branch of the military and the toughest assignment together .
So these guys can be sitting in a bar next to some Marines .
Marines say , " so what are you ? "
And they say , " we 're in the Coast Guard . "
And maybe they snicker a little , but they should n't !
What makes people assume the Coast Guard is the softest branch ?
Ignorance ?
Maybe you never served in any Military branch and have no frame of reference ?
Not to diminish the great Navy Fleet Sailors who keep the gigantic ships running with all kinds of technical skills , Coast Guard people are the real Sailors who navigate tiny boats in high seas to rescue people , arrest criminals and keep America 's shores safe .
It 's not surprising that they could complete SEAL training if they wanted to .
I 've been reading through several news sites tonight and I just picked up on a great story about a US Air Force pilot who probably saved a lot of US Military lives in the early goings of the Iraq War .
Now let 's get one thing straight , I initially agreed with the reason for going into Iraq , but I no longer agree with it .
I support Obama 's decision to pull our troops out by next year .
I always , 100 % side with our brave men and women who are putting themselves in harm 's way .
Now today , I came upon this story on TV .
Lieutenant Colonel Victor Fehrenbach .
He was promoted to Lt. Colenel in 2006 .
He 's part of the 325th Fighter Wing Mission that serves off of Tyndall Air Force Base flying F - 15C 's and F - 22 Raptors .
He 's been in the Air Force for 18 years .
He is just 2 years short of retirement .
He 's flown missions in Iraq , Afghanistan , Kosovo and has been awaiting re - deployment a new tour of duty .
If you know anything about air force , he 's Afelm JT Fly Trng .
Back in 2003 this hero won the Air Medal for Heroism .
Back in April , 2003 the Army was making the initial advance to capture Baghdad Int'l airport , Victor and his wingmen found an Iraqi ambush site of about 12 APCs that were less than a mile from the Army advance .
At the time , his wingman was suffering from a major malfunction in his plane that prohibited him from deploying his weapons .
Within a timespan of 20-30 minutes , he and his wingman were finally able to deploy all of their weapons and destroy the 8 APCs that were about to ambush the US Army on their mission to take Baghdad International Airport .
They took out the entire enemy position and that night the Army captured Baghdad International Airport .
Why am I posting this when there have been several hundred if not thousand of other US Soldiers , Seamen and Pilots who have each served their country heroicly and have also won medals , which some have even died for ?
Because this hero was 2 years away from retirement and is being discharged , against his will , from the Air Force . Is this because of bad behavior ? No. He has an excellent record of service and has never had any problems . Then why , if this 18 - year veteran who is an excellent Pilot of the US Air Force being discharged against his will , 2 years before he retires ?
Because he 's openly gay . He 's commanded squadrons , saved other American soldiers ' lives and served with honor .
But because he is different than we are , because he is sexually attracted to men , his sexuality trumps the incredible record of service he 's had over 18 years .
Are you telling me that the most professionally trained , the meanest , the fiercest military in the world that can destroy any other enemy and accomplish any goal its given , cannot accept men or women who have different seuxality tastes than other people ?
This Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell law absolutely MUST be repealed immediately !
Men and women who fight to save our country , who are more than willing to die to protect our freedom , must NOT be discriminated against .
It 's time to end prejudice and time to accept human beings for who they are - ESPEICALLY our heroic men and women in the US Military . Support Our Troops !
ALL OF THEM !
In these troubled times we simply cannot do without this significant portion of potential enlistees , and talented senior members , to uphold an absurd , and bigoted , policy .
Most absurdly , we are allowing ourselves to fire Arabic language specialists , people whose positions are critical at this time , due to a trait that has no effect on the performance of their duties .
I know congress has a lot on their plates right now , but they need to move on this soon .
Preferably with a solution that would allow soldiers lost to this idiotic policy to reenlist if they still wish to .
Its not that the military is against gays .
The military is against things that make it run less efficiently .
Allowing blacks to enter the military increased its numbers and productivity thus the long term goals outweighed the short term unease .
Allowing openly gay men / women into the service would create Long term discomfort and you would see a decrease in troop numbers as well as military efficiency .
Because of the nature of the military and close quarters shared especially among men in war simulation , training and actual warfare the distraction of having someone who you know may be attracted to you can ultimately cause death because you are distracted .
Julia Gillard has beaten her predecessor Kevin Rudd in a ballot for the federal Labor leadership by a margin of 73 votes to 29 .
Follow events as they happen on our live blog .
2. Rudd has said he would retire if he lost .
Now is not the time to be bickering with an election coming .
4. I 've been in New Zealand the past two weeks ...
... where the Australian political story has been top news .
The local papers are of the opinion that , whomever won the leadership contest , the Labour Party was likely to be heavily damaged going into next year 's elections .
Local OWS activists were part of this protest .
File this under " Holy S * * * ! "
Hundreds of protesters from various groups converged on the state capitol in Topeka , Kansas today .
Shortly before the protesters arrived , Capitol Police discovered a truck laden with explosives parked outside the capitol .
Yeah , this sounds like bullshit .
One , the protesters were not targeted .
That 's an invention of the blog reprinting this .
Second , I have a really hard time believing that there were any ACTUAL " explosives , " since the news story they link to talks about one guy getting arrested for THREATENING Governor Brownback .
Nothing about explosives charges , etcetera , which they 'd be quick on top of if there were any actual explosives .
Given the way these stories get exaggerated , " several improvised explosive devices " could mean anything down to a few bundles of firecrackers -- or nothing at all , since false reports are n't at all uncommon .
Doubly so since they apparently did not even bother to tow the truck , so clearly there was n't a serious threat .
Translation out of hype - speak : some kook made threatening noises at Brownback and got arrested . The end .
Of what Am I trying to convince you ?
I 'm expressing my own views here .
What you believe is of concern only in terms of debate .
And possibly adding to my knowledge if I 'm convinced there 's justification .
So far , NOT .
If that article represents the final word on " substance " to you , that 's fine with me .
I am , and remain skeptical .
I 'm sure they found something .
Hard to make any case at all without something tangible .
What it is , who put it there , and why remain , for me , unknown , and also remain deciding factors for me .
Wingnut / Hard for me to grasp . Goodness , disagreeing with you causes personal attacks . Not hard to believe when considering the weakness of your argument .
This is excellent news , we needed a counter balance !
It was revealed in January that Rupert Murdoch / News Corp were creating the right wing spanish version of Fox News .
1. what makes u think these channels will be a counter balance to anything lol nt
2. Because when all else fails , I still trust in Mickey !
3. Disney 's ABC Network has been rated the second most conservative news coverage .
Still , a conservatively biased channel is preferable to a conservative propaganda channel , which is what the Fox Spanish channel will certainly be .
4. How is Univisions coverage ?
I understood that it was a center left network .
I turned on my coputer this morning and instead of opening the internet to my Google home page ( White ) it opened to a page called " Blackle " which was black .
I thought , hmm , they do funny things with the Google letters for holidays , so maybe today is Blackle Wednesday or something .
I " Blackled " it and found out they changed the page to black to save energy .
Does this make sense ?
Any teeth to this and if so , does it make enough of a differrence for web developers to switch ?
I just Googled Google and when I click on the first selection it takes me to the white Google page , so apparently we still have a choice .
The new search from Google has the Blackle.com address , not google .
Also , when we have a choice for skins , like I think we do ( or did at one time ) here on A 2K , then we could all contribute to the energy savings by using the black skin , right ?
So , we could participate that way , too .
( Although I find the black page harder to read . )
Anyone familiar with the workings of energy that could explain the black page using less ?
Or , whether or not it is that significant ?
Only so long as they have no redeeming qualities , I imagine .
It is always wrong to kill anybody , whatever they have done .
I heard it costs upwards of one million dollars to execute one prisoner ; that sure buys a whole lot of years in prison .
A concurrent thread has touched on the the role of religion in the US Civil Rights movement , and its place in the US constitution .
Is the " equality " issue " religious wish fulfilment " which flies in the face of biological and sociological " fact " ?
I think you are answering if two men are the " same " and not necessarily if they are equal in rights or should be .
T K O
I see equality as a goal to strive for , although in effect , it is somewhat arbitrary , dependant on the whims of changing times .
While riding the bus earlier this week , I overheard a man say that if he " had the guts to do it , " he would jump off an overpass .
He followed up with an affirmation that he would never do it because he would never find those guts .
We are probably all familiar with the traditional saying regarding suicide - that it is a " coward 's way out . "
My question is this : Is it really ? Or is it the opposite ?
That is , does the act of suicide actually require courage to commit ?
Personally I believe it requires a tremendous amount of courage and perhaps the greatest amount of courage of any possible action .
After all , we are speaking of terminating one 's own life , perhaps forever ending one 's existence .
We all have our thoughts on what comes next , but no one can be certain .
One may be forever ending his existence , or he may be forever subjecting himself to punishment if the religious views on suicide being a sin are correct .
Either way though , one is entering the unknown by willingly terminating his life , which blatantly violates the biological drive to live , to continue existing .
How can this not be an extremely courageous act , much more so that " finding the courage to remain alive in the face of unbeatable problems ? "
Remaining alive to face one 's problems is continuing the state of existence that one has always known .
Ending that life is journeying into something new , something that may be better or may be worse than the current state of existence the individual is comfortably familiar with .
Either way he is terminating his life and accepting the state of death that deep down we all fear .
How can one consider voluntarily entering that state cowardly ?
@Elmud , Well , I think your reasoning has merit :
[ INDENT ] One is fearful of some thing One overcomes their fear to do that thing In so doing , one can therefore said to have courage [ / INDENT ]
So yes ; strictly speaking , I think you 're correct .
Although I must admit , it strikes me as very unproductive to give praiseworthy words to such an act .
" He had the courage to kill himself " ; though correct in this sense , leads to a ' destructive ' conclusion .
As a side note , labeling it as a " cowardly " or " easy " way out - I think - is simply people using derision to express their disapproval .
Such disapproval may be certainly warranted - and I disapprove of it generally - but what one must go through ( mentally , emotionally and / or experiencially ) can hardly be called " easy " .
I can also envision a state where , for me , such a solution could be warranted ; not a good one to be sure , but conceivable nonetheless .
To fight with every last stitch of breath for even the most - remote possibility for " things getting better " is what I hold to .
Interesting twist on the issue . Thanks for posting
@WithoutReason , It is a purely courageous act , especially if you prepared for it so that it was least painful for your loved ones .
I do n't know if it could be argued as a logical choice , per se , especially if you had not yet tried letting go of all the things that bring you down ( psychologically speaking ) .
But , if you just got your arms and legs blown off by and IED , then by all means , have at it . ( Err ... have someone do it for you . )
According to most analyses , from within and without the petroleum Industry , the world supply of oil , relative consumption , will effectively peak in the next decade .
What does this mean ?
If demand exceeds supply , someone will neccessarily have to go without .
The issue is who ?
Some nations will be priced out , most likely the relatively undeveloped countries in which automotive transportation is not really essential .
However , when there is not enough oil to satisfy even the industrialized nations , which totally depend on oil not only for transportation , but for farming , various chemicals industries , etc. , how will they likely respond ?
Obviously , war is a possiblity ; they have been fought for far less in the past .
Of course , access to petroleum itelf is not the only issue .
Most of the world 's food is grown using modern farming methods that require enormous amounts of gas .
If the amount of surplus food suddenly decreases as a result of peak oil , the poor around the world will starve , lamentable in itself , causing instabilities that could lead to conflict over scarce resoures .
China comes to mind .
The economy of that nation is being built , with questionable logic by the central planners , on the western model : i.e. dependent on cheap petroleum .
What is unique about China is that the ruling party 's legitmacy is intimately assosciated with rapid economic progress .
If this were suddenly to halt or risk collapse , would that ruling party push the country into war , either to acquire access to oil or simply as a distraction , as so many authoritarian regimes have done in the past ?
There is shift of power occuring in Asia , as China and Russia exert their influence .
The Shangai Cooperation Organization of which they , along with Ian , Pakistan and most of the former Soviet republics , are memebers , has stated that it intends to remove U.S. influence from the region and failitate the rise of a ' multi - polar world . '
I do n't want to guess their specific motives , but it seems to me that such an arrangement could be very advanategous for those nations in the event of a crisis brought on by peak oil .
Between Russia and Iran , they would have access to enormous oil reserves , from which they could , if supplies were too short , deny the U.S. Saudi Arabia comes to mind as well .
As anyone who has done even the most superficial research on that nation would know , the House of Saud is a joke , a paper tiger and a tyranny hated by most of its people .
If elections were held their , or if there was a struggle for power , the regime that woudl arise would be friendly with Iran and extremely antagonistic to the U.S. : quite understandably I might add .
With the largest oil reserves in the world , it is vital that the U.S. maintain contorl over Saudi Arabia , which means propping up the House of Saud , and it would be equally benificial to Iran or to China and its partners in Asia to facilitate a revolution there , which would allow them greater access by default .
And so , after all that , which you might justly consider paranoia , my question is basically this ; in light of the threat of peak oil , and of the general decline in American economic might relative the rest of the world ( not to mention the current U.S. crisis ) , what do think the world will look like in a decade or two ?
If American hegemony fails , as appears inevitable , what will be its replacement ?
Nice post and important issue .
I really , really hope that alternative sources are being as enthusiastically - pursued as the urgency of the situation dictates they should .
But the first , perhaps facetious , response I had to " what would happen " - question was to recall the 80 's movies : Mad Max , and Mad Mad : Road Warrior
I 'll admit though : There 's a part of me that wants to see all this fossil - fuel B.S. come tumbling down .
Even if it set transportation , technology and civilization in general back some , I 'd think a " reboot in a better direction " ( read : away from finite resources , fossil fuels ) is so much the better .
Yea , more war over oil resources is likely ; perhaps even inevitable .
There is no question that the coming century will see a confluence and will be a critical turning point in human history .
Peak oil will be one of the primary drivers of this process .
We may very well be called upon to choose between collective life and death .
The potential is there for both .
If we so choose to do so the technology we will have available in the near term future is perfectly capable of salvaging the situation .
But if we do n't and we allow our technological civilisation to collapse under its own weight , the next generations of humans will have to do without the major stepping stone of an oil based economy .
There simply will not be enough oil left .
They may not be able to kickstart their own industrial era .
I think what you are going to see is a shift towards localized economies .
As the oil supply becomes smaller and population grows there just will not be enough to feed the system .
Hopefully , people realize that it is going to take oil to move beyond oil , so the focus should be using what is readily available wisely , before the shift becomes extremely expensive .
I just Read of Arthur C Clark 's death in Sri Lanka -- he is primarily know as a science fiction author , but his science fiction presaged many of the technologies that we now consider plebian .
His prediction of geosychronous satellites in the 40 's are now so utilitarian that this 24 hour equatorial orbit is now known as the Clark orbit ,
Many other of his ' fictions ' have now become casual technology .
I remember when he did that show " mysterious universe " about enigmas and theories about things like Easter island , great pyramids , and Stonehenge .
Great man , great body of work , a truly enlightened soul who will revisit us again I 'm sure .
See you in the blink of an eye , buddy .
This was sad news .
I enjoyed his books and his perspective on things .
Another giant gone .
Shame nobody ( except a quoted person ) spelled his name right .
I could n't for the life of me figure out where to post this question , so I thought I 'd put it here since it 's biologically relevant ... somewhat .
Do n't ask me why but I need to know what happens if you dye your eyebrows .
Say you want to disguise yourself by bleaching dark hair blonde and that you wanted to do the eyebrows as well to complete the disguise .
Now the hair on your head will eventually grow and you 'll lose the blonde - ness , but what about the eyebrows ?
I do n't remember ever having them cut or trimmed , so would they stay blonde ?
Eyebrows have a different " terminal length " than head - hair -- that is , they grow to a certain length ( and not longer ) , then fall out .
They 're still going through the growth process , though .
The old ones fall out , the new ones fall in .
So it 'd have to be re - done at intervals , yep .
This excessive concern with little eyebrows is a trifle odd .
I do n't think soz is looking to disguise herself .
I think she 's on the vamp .
According to Darwin it is the males who do the vamping .
What 's the scientific explanation of the reversal in humans ?
Its the same with long - haired dogs and short - haired dogs .
The short haired dog has hair strands that ( on the average ) fall out or break before the average long - haired dog 's .
Eyebrow hairs grow much slower than head hair , so if you dye everything together , your head hair will show " roots " long before the eyebrows do .
I dye my eyebrows all the time , whether I 'm doing a touch up to the roots , or my entire head .
So , that 's every 2 weeks .
I do n't know how fast my eyebrows grow , but after 2 weeks there 's always a grey one in there somewhere .
I guess they grow as fast as women seem to need to pluck them .
BTW , when you 're dying them , use a Q - tip , and make sure you get it all the way to the root .
I rather suspect that the " there is a GOD who always was -- and the GOD created what we see and can infer exists " scenario has more appeal forl you .
Am I correct ?
A " Theory " is nothing more than an explanation of known facts ... when and if the facts change , the theory would be expected to change . Therefore , any proposed " Theory " that is not supported by known facts is to be rejected . However , support for any one theory does not
automatically lead to a rejection of a second or even a third if those
theories are also supported by the facts .
Facts , not interpetations , are the basis for evaluation . An open and
curious mind and a regard for truth are still the basis for good science .
Media coverage and political support are not .
It 's a common argument that the Universe is tuned " just so " for life to exist , and that any slight modification means that " life " would be impossible .
But this premise assumes that life as we know it is the only form of life that * can * exist . And I disagree with this assumption .
The life we see around us evolved in this Universe as conditions allowed , so it 's not surprising at all that everything fits nicely . Other Universes with different rules would necessarily have life in them which fits that universe . And Universes which are sterile have no life in them to question the fact that they are not there .
The really interesting thing to realize is that life evolves in Universes ( at least this one ) at all . Is the evolution of life in a Universe pure chance , or is it inevitable ?
In our universe at least , life not only can exist , but does exist . And that means that our Universe is itself , alive , in a very real sense . And we are its thoughts .
A variant on the multi universe which seems to me obvious , and very real , is the infinite universe .
Here the universe that we perceive is simply one cell of infinity , the others being like or unlike " cells " beyond our own , but filling the remainder of " everything " beyond our specific " this " with " otherthings " , identical , or not .
If we look at the magnitudinal stratification of this universe we go from , as we interpret it , and with our current ability to decern at sub nano levels , the smallest subatomic particles through atoms , molecules , solids , constructs , and on , and on , and on , to planets , star systems , galaxies , and on to our entire known universe .
Would it not be foolish to assume this " Mandelbrot " like lattice would stop at the extreem of our meagre ability to observe , rather than continue to follow its serial makeup to unimagined levels of structure , and beyond to infinity ( infinity , of course not being a point , but rather a lack of constraint quantifier ) .
multiverse
I was working on a research project on the concept of the multiverse and while I enjoyed the incoherent rambling argument on whether there is a god or not Im feeling kind of empty . The universe is the way it is because if it werent then we wouldnt be able to contemplate on whether therte is a god or not . And trying to justify the existence of god through anything dealing with relativity is laughable . God is only able to exist through faith . And faith goes against everything that science stands for .
A key issue in disscussion of " life " and " universes " is what constitutes " structure " or " order " . For example , to take BGW 's ( and Capra 's ) fractal model of embedded " structures " we are still left with the regression problem of " who observes / defines such structure " .
My own conclusion is that terms like " multiverse " have no separate reality with respect to a singular concept whilst the criteria for " reality " concern explanation of what we call " events " in the single universe . I am saying that the occurence of " life " is not an " event " in the usual sense because events presuppose " observers " who classify them as such . ( Observation in " our minds eye " is cognitive sleight of hand ) Note also the term " multi " implies " one who classifies or counts " and we can ask again who is this other than ourselves ?
In short , the corollary the universe appears like it is because we are like we are is equally valid .
The transcendent question is of course " what constitutes explanation " and how can this encompass the interaction of observer and observed ?
Rather than take a reductionist view proposing infinite , slightly different universes that somehow interact ( alah M - Theory ) , allow for strong emergence via the Landauer - Lloyd analysis of flaws in the of the Laplace 's demon argument that supports reductionists . Basically this states the final outcome of a system may not be soley defined by outcomes written into the basic laws of physics * a gazzillion atoms , but there can be " a cosmic imperative " written into the laws of nature ( Paul Davies - Macquarie Uni - Sydney , Australia - Emergent biological principles and the computational resources of the universe , Complexity vol 10 ( 2 ) , p1 "
So basically ultra complex systems can produce wierd outcomes ; such as rocks , intelligent life or high temperature superconductors all from the same raw materials - simply arranged slightly differentally . This might bring down the number of universes required to create life from infinite to merely fairly large !
Can we PLEASE get these people a voice in Washington ?
How long are we supposed to wait to see if this womans brain will ever rewire effectively before we move on ?
We Americans have let our victim fetish get so bad that we are pathetic .
If I were in AZ - 08 , I think this would be a fair question but I 'm not sure of what the mechanism to remove a Congresswoman is other than the ballot box .
Strom Thurmond was not all there but still held his office with the consent of his constituents .
I think as long as her constituents are ok with it , we do n't get a say .
As Butrflynet pointed out , Gabrielle Gifford 's office is doing quite a lot .
That does n't seem incidental or trivial to me .
Gabrielle Giffords was voted in because people agreed with her policies and approach to politics .
She hand - selected this group of people who now make up her office , with the intent of working together to implement her vision .
In that way , she is still the representative , as these people take her stated vision and priorities and work to make them happen .
If Giffords is unable to recover fully before the next election , I think it would make sense that her second - in - command , or whomever has been most instrumental in the work that her office has been doing since the injury , goes ahead and runs in her place .
I think engineer 's point about not encouraging removal from office by gunshot is a good one .
The members of the minority party in the House of Representatives are largely ciphers anyway , although only a few of them have the excuse that they suffer from medically certifiable brain damage .
All the Democrats in the house could take a year - long vacation and the results would largely be the same , so Giffords 's absence from her duties is hardly consequential .
Indeed , the country would benefit if more congressmen could be induced to take extended breaks from their duties .
It might be a good idea to keep track of this woman . Some basics from her wiki biography might be helpful .
The Congresswoman , who is about to turn 55 , was born in Iowa . When her parents divorced , she moved to Minnesota with her mother . She worked in a kibbutz after high school , attended Winona State University , the now defunct law school at Oral Roberts University and the William and Mary Law School where she took a master 's degree in tax law .
She has been married for 30 years . " Bachmann and her husband own a Christian counseling clinic in Stillwater , Minnesota .
Bachmann also has an ownership stake in Waumandee , Wisconsin farm land . Since the death of her father - in - law , the farm and its buildings have been rented out to a neighboring farmer who maintains a dairy herd on the farm . From 1995 through 2006 , the tenant - farmer received $ 251,973 in federal subsidies , chiefly for dairy and corn price supports . "
Initially a Democrat , she became disillusioned with Jimmy Carter . In 1976 , the CHristian documentary by Francis Schaeffer , " How Should We Then Live ? " impelled her to take up an anti - abortion stance and she and her fiance began praying outside abortion facilities .
" In 1993 , Bachmann and other parents started a K - 12 charter school in Stillwater , and she began speaking against a state - mandated set of educational standards , which propelled her into the world of politics .
Bachmann became an outspoken critic and opponent of Minnesota 's School - to - Work policies . In a 1999 column , she wrote : " School - to - Work alters the basic mission and purpose of K - 12 academic education away from traditional broad - based academic studies geared toward maximizing intellectual achievement of the individual . Instead , School - to - Work utilizes the school day to promote children 's acquisition of workplace skills , viewing children as trainees for increased economic productivity . " *
* My reaction : what a surprise .
I love Michele Bachmann !
With any luck , she will be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential race .
A dream opponent for the dems , really .
Now , if her running mate were to be someone named Turner , the dems could be in trouble , like , a Bachmann - Turner ticket would blow them off the road once the campaign got into overdrive .
Doubt if she 'd adopt an anti - vocational ed stance , though .
All I know , is the more I see her on television , the better .
Youtube : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAaDVOd2sRQ
@33export ,
I 'm not certain that everyone will " get " the reference to Bachmann - Turner . The Canadians , however , will .
@plainoldme ,
It made me laugh ( and I am American ) .
Thats only because you aint seen nothing yet .
@maxdancona ,
My comment was simply a reply to the backhanded reference to BTO .
IMHO , Michele Bachmann is not as sharp as a bowling ball and has no business even thinking about running for President .
I love watching Michele Bachmann . She is funnier than any sitcom on television . Bad thing is she makes Mitt Ronmey look very solid . I mean , compared to Palin and Bachmann , Romney sounds like Einstein LOL .
@jcboy ,
I believe that Bachmann has a real chance of beating Romney for the nomination . I think it will come down to the two of them , and Romney 's negatives , from being a Mormon to having taken so many positions in the past that annoy conservatives .
A " selection of recent articles on the Republican presidential wannabe and Tea Party darling " , from the New Statesman HERE
@Walter Hinteler ,
As amusing as a Bachmann candidacy would be , itll never happen . There are some intelligent people in the RNC who realize that this would be tantamount to handing over the presidential race to Obama without firing a shot . The RNC is scared that the public may love her like they do Sarah . With the GOP trying to find its " center of mass " they are p [ arading out these clowns that can only cause them big trouble in November 2012
It 's that time again .
Politicians running for mid - term elections are attacking their opponents and in doing so , stretching truths where ever they may be found .
I want to get a list of fact check websites going .
It 'd be interesting to see if different sites come up with the same facts ....
i figure someone should just start a website called They All Lie dot com and just post pics of all the candidates , that would certainly make it easier
I 'm kind of cynical that fact even matter anymore .
We 've left the information age , we are well into the opinion age .
That idiotic GOP " Pledge to America " was ripped to shreds by Factcheck.org , but it wo n't matter because those who believe it ( or at least believe in the idea of it ) wo n't ever dare venture near a fact checking source .
I think we need a new web service that fact checks , but also tracks who comes and reads the facts .
You must have been reading the Pledge to America , in which the GOP promises to return the country to failed Bush policies of borrow and spend and the elimination of oversight and regulation .
It was his policies that brought us a net job loss over ten years ( first in history ) , banks that became , in essence , hedge funds , sleazy sub - prime mortgage loans , torture , corruption , etc.
Moreover , privatizing social security and Medicare is a prescription for disaster .
( Check with the Brits who went through this relative to their version of social security . )
As Reagan would say here we go again .
K - Mart is closing 326 stores and laying off approximately 35,000 people .
It is almost a daily ritual with the announcement of massive layoffs .
President Bush on the other hand continues to claim the economy is strong , not as strong as it could be but strong nonetheless .
He has however presented a package which he contends will stimulate the economy and create jobs .
Over half of the package $ 367 billion will come by removing the tax on dividends .
What do you think of the package will it stimulate the economy ?
In addition if the economy remains sluggish what are Bush 's chances for re - election ?
Yeah , it 'll stimulate the top ten percent of the wealthy in this country , but will do nothing for our economy .
Money must be put into the hands of the middle class and the poor for our economy to be stimulated .
The best way to accomplish that is to cut everybody 's taxes by ten percent effective January 1 , 2003 .
That 'll pump about a half trillion dollars into our economy . c.i.
Well , I thought it would be nice to see that title somewhere ... since I ca n't find it in Reality ....
It is wild to me how such an effective , strong , woman -- the closest advisor to the most powerful person in the world -- has garnered no more support , no accolades from women and blacks -- two groups who are always trying to find successful sisters or positive stories of black achievement .
I have noticed a distinct discrimination among women and blacks in whom they will ballyhoo , and whom they wo n't .
If any other woman in this country had soared to the heights Condi has reached , it would be Mardi Gras 24/7 ...
Clarence Thomas is unwelcomed among his own race .
The second black person to serve on the SCOTUS .
Even if he had a disfiguring pigment problem and a third leg , if he were the slightest bit liberal -- he 'd have statues and streets named after him already .
I heard a Georgia mayor on NPR today , and was heartened .
He was explaining to the ( of course , liberal ) quizzical reporter how he could be a Republican .
It was as if he had to apologize to the entire black community ...
I was proud that he told the reporter he felt racially stereotyped to be expected to be a Democrat .
He should n't be expected to be anything .
It is to the great , abiding shame of women and blacks to turn their backs on the great achievements of these people .
It is the New Racism ; by blacks against blacks .
The New Feminist Sexism . Appalling .
Some liberals do n't much cotton to " uppity " blacks like Powell , Thomas and Rice confronting racial discrimination and outright racism and leaving the plantation of dependency on white liberals and achieving the great things they are capable of .
Gotta ' keep ' em in their place , you know .
What does women or black have to do with it .
Clinton had a women secretary of state , and Rice does not represent blacks , so what is your beef ?
What amuses me about Rice is that she lived in the South during the Civil Rights movement , and that experience seems to have left her untouched .
Yet Bush mentioned that background as though she actually did anything beyond striving toward her own growth .
More power to her for her achievements .
But do n't be surprised if you 're not hearing wild applause from her community , because I 'm not sure she has one ...
Assuming she establishes a credible name for herself as Secretary of State , I am cautiously anticipating the GOP nominee in 2008 to be Condoleeza Rice .
And yes , I think she can be elected easily assuming that the GOP is allowed something close to a level playing field .
I think Colin Powell against Gore or Kerry in the last two elections would have won by a landslide .
Americans , especially Republican Americans , have largely left issues of racism and / or stereotypical prejudice and bigotry well behind them .
Any qualified person with charisma and a track record can compete with clout .
I keep hearing that inflation is under control .
And I suppose it is if one does not need to put food on the table , buy gasoline , heating oil , electricity and many of the necessities of life .
From your prospective do you find inflation to be a non - factor ?
Did n't seem to have much effect on the last couple of yachts I bought .
Now , I hear that high end housing ( 1 1/2 million + ) are also holding the line in some areas .
This whole economy seems to be based on the comfort level of the ones referred to by Dubya as his base .
Lock up all scumbags .
Lock 'm up .
Make 'm work .
Break up the gangs .
If you get caught with meth , got to jail ...
there is no unfortunate case .
You had dope its illegal , you knew it was illegal before you had the dope .
And to whomever spoke of the INNOCENCE in prison , Quit talking like that is the norm .
99.9 % of inmates deserve to be there .
I will take those odds in vegas any day .
Please pick Bloomberg to be your vicepresident .
Please read this if you do n't instantly see why ... http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1632736,00.html
He would ensure that moderates , libertarians , and technocrats sick of politics as usual would vote for you .
He is easily among the most competent politicians we have .
He researches and practices evidence based politics and thus virtually every policy he sought no matter how unpopular proved a success .
And he like you knows how to balance budgets without hurting the economy .
He can also pay for the election campaign .
I highly doubt that Bloomberg is going to switch parties .
He 's already an Independent ( switched from Republican ) .
But , offset Hillary 's " Northeastern Elite " and " inexperienced " negatives with Bloomberg 's " Northeastern Elite " and " inexperienced " negatives ? Not so much .
personally i look upon this conflict as the source of 90 % of western - muslim 's confrontation ,
the US needs and so supports Israel , Israel wants to stop attacks on its citizens and so strike on palestinian targets , which in turn results in more attacks on Israel , this increases the number of radical muslims too , which results in attacks against america around the world ( military targets , embassies , and citizens ) resulting in american foriegn policy like the war on Iraq and / or Afghanistan , and the circle continues , reactions to actions resulting in reactions , this circle having No beginning and no end
is not easy to solve , but if we try to and start by the issue at core ( palestinian - Israeli conflict ) the rest can be handled ,
i want to start a thread here , that simulates peace negotiations between two sides , palestinians ( me and who ever volunteers ) against Israeli side ( i suppose Volunteer wouldnot mind representing them and any one he chooses )
each side is allowed one posting per day , then after every two posts its discussed freely by all for two days , then each side makes a post , as the palestinian side is the one with most demands lets let them start ( if its ok by all ) ,
i need ur OK guys and Girls .
very true , the same people who said SADDAM violated UN resolutions , seem to forget , ISRAEL has been in violation of UN resolutions for decades .
Give up hell , tell them to come get it ?
That goes for Isreal too , if Egypt or Syria were anything worthwhile , Isreal would n't of got what they did .
To the victor goes the spoils .
Glad I 've never backed the UN .
Israel is Western , civilized , the progenitors of the first Christian community , and facing total annihilation every day of its life , thanks to being surrounded by psycopathic states .
THEREFORE ....... we must back it . : headbang :
So you think if Isreal stopped retaliating , the attacks would stop ?
No chance of that , they would chip at them untill they were extinct .
Max Blumenthal goes to the Young Republicans convention in DC , and asks why none of them - who strongly support the WoT and the War in Iraq - have bothered to sign up and serve in the armed forces .
Unsurprisingly , there were plenty of excuses banded about .
Republicans get mad when the ' Chickenhawk ' argument is brought up , and this is because it is damned effective .
They usually attempt to counter with some version of this line :
It is n't stupid , though .
There is a perceivable and significant differnce between those who discuss war , who think it is sometimes necessary , and who are willing to do what must be done for US safety ; and the War Cheerleaders .
The actively aggressive advocates of warfare as a solution to life 's problems .
Those are the Chickenhawks : the ones who continually advocate the solving of our national Foreign policy problems using armed force .
The ones who suggest that the US is so strong , we can go it alone if we have to and we should n't be held back from attacking other countries by little things like , say , international conventions .
They advocate using maximum force to win ; their problem with the war in Iraq is that we are n't killing enough people over there , innocents included .
These people , who cheer on the deaths of others , who think that force is the best way to get what we want - but do n't sign up to serve themselves - are Chickenhawks .
They are too cowardly to put their ass on the line , but continually advocate that others do so .
This topic is right on the money .
These leeches and vultures are the ones getting rich off of the nation 's blood .
They stand safely back , saying , " Let 's you and them fight .
Me ? I 'll cheer you on , while me and my friends get rich off your efforts . "
There was a time when I strongly supported the invasion of Iraq , and it had nothing to do with presenting the good people of Iraq with a democratic form of government .
Oh , I also spent 5 years in the US Army , from a time when most of us had heard of Indochina , through the period when just everybody could name each country in the region .
So , I 'm an oddball . S'okay .
Yes , I would imagiane that Patrick Daniel Tillman most likely did n't need the $ when he enlisted but it is curious why Bush rendered the investigation of his death as a secret of national security .
The Chinese are going to stab us in the back . if we do n't turn away from Iraq and Afghanistan to rebuild / recover our strength . Where they 're financially and militarily , bleeding us to death .
Fine , threaten to sell Aegis equipped ships to Taiwan if they do so .
If China were to do that , they would be cutting their own throats .
The LAST thing that China wants is a weak dollar because that would completely wipe out any chance of a trade surplus from their number one trading partner ... the U.S.
A weak dollar means lots and lots of closed down factories in China because the Americans ca n't afford their widgets and doohickies .
They will threaten , they will try to influence , but they wo n't ' drop the bomb ' unless they have a guarantee of some other country willing to buy several hundred billion dollars worth of junk a year .
What do you think the consequences would be ?
Do you think the Shrub could pull it off ?
If not , why ?
His approval rating cannot sink , so , what 's the risk .
After all , he 's the Decider , and Congress holds his trousers while he skinny dips .
Does America want us to lose this war and cut and run as Reid and Pelosi have impose upon our president ?
Does America want us to have to fight our way back in in six month or a year with a death toll in multiples of thousands over a radically less period of time ?
Also if we pull out of Iraq and go into Darfur what will be the justification for joining that war , WMD ?
Reid and Pelosi telling the government not to fight America 's war is like congress and the senate telling the government not to fight racism and the KKK a few decades back .
These cowardly democrats are bargaining that Americans will be stupid and not realize the deeper war that will have to be re - fought in only a few short years .
Iran and Russia will be the next war along with Chavez if we do not create a successful democracy in Iraq .
The power vacuum will in Iraq pull Iran and Russia and possibly the whole middle east and maybe even China into an allied front against America .
This my friends is Armageddon .
Reid and Pelosi have been told this I am sure but they simply do n't care .
Winning elections trumps all other concerns ...
Do we really want these people setting public policy ?
Why not leave and let the Iraqis fight the war ?
Answer : If the Most powerful army is already struggling in this war what will it be like when we pull out and come back in six months to a year ?
Reid and Pelosi stop trying to shove your partisan politics at our president over the generals " sound " military policies .
Listening to your bribe bibber Murtha instead of our generals ...
Seven friggin ' years of this crap is ENOUGH !!!
If we pull out now the disaster will be on YOUR heads just in time for election ...
The blood of freedom is at stake and the very people who claim to value it are now our own worst enemies .
The new democratic KKK selling our freedom and dignity simply for power .
Does America look to geniuses such as yourself for analysis ?
. Now I know you are just kidding , that attitude is just whacky otherwise .
There are tons of examples in history of ill advised " proactive " wars , and most of these were eventually lost by the aggressors
Also , rex , try to be civilized and dont resort to childish name calling .
Its usually a sign of an inability to craft an argument solely based upon the issues at hand .
Just because you feel passionately about this doesnt automatically mean that others will embrace your opinions .
OH YEH , AND , if you call me a coward again , Ill come up there to Jonesport , hunt you down , and buy you a drink first .
I 'm thinking Farmerman means what he says .
The day it becomes truly cowardly of one to suggest an end to mindless mayhem is the day I want to float off this planet .
Edgar , you know its a cynical attempt at " spin " by the rapidly sinking SS Bush .
His " handlers " are trying to cover ytracks and leave a legacy that is goona leve his presidency up there with Harding or Buchanan .
( oy , theres a comparison , Buchanan , I believe started the first of the ' proactive wars " against the Mormons ) ,
People like you have done more to screw this country up than " the democrats " could ever have hoped to do .
You repeatedly voted for and supported a president and an administration who was clearly and obviously incompetent and ideologically extreme .
This was evident from campaign through the early years of governance .
You think that America means red , white , and blue and war and think nothing of shredding the constitution on the way to more blood and glory .
And you dare to presume that you are somehow the " real Americans " and the rest of us , those of us who actually know what the Constitution says and know what this ignoramus is trying to do to it , are somehow going to destroy " your " country .
You wave your flag and trust an ignorant incompetent who ca n't even run this country to somehow rebuild another , one that he did n't even begin to understand and had never been to .
You trust an idiot .
You think the answer to incompetence and mismanagement is faith .
You and your brethren , the Bush die - hards , have sent this country in a death spiral .
And sadly , the only people we can have any hope of pulling us out are the " other party " .
A party that already was waning in respect due to corruption and its willingness to take some fundamental social justice concepts too far is now supported by a majority of the public , and the beloved party of small government and individual liberties is now a hulking rusty heap of corruption , scandal , incompetence , special interests , big government , and domestic spying .
maybe I am , and maybe I 'm saying that you 're an idiot .
Hard to say exactly . : wink :
You mean SCUT FARKAS and his sidekick " toady " was Grover Dill , who was actually beaten up by Delbert Bumpus .
I need to set these things correct so that the record will be clear testimonyat Rex 's sanity hearing .
I am a conservative , and you are an idiot .
You said ..
Most Christions I know will not bow to another God , no matter who that God is .
Thats why so many Christians were killed by the ancient Romans , they refused to bow down .
Also , to use an old cliche ... " I would rather die on my feet then live on my knees "
I was reading in the paper today about all the laws under consideration that would make it harder for Americans to vote when I suddenly flashed on all the purple fingered Iraqi voters that were so celebrated in our press only a few short years ago .
I think I must be missing something because I 'm really confused by this .
Why would any state do anything that would make it harder for it 's citizens to vote ?
Please can someone explain this to me ?
That 's pretty easy .
Conseratives figure ( and probably with justification ) that their voter base will get out and vote without regard for any minor hurdles which might be thrown in their way .
They rely on older citizens and more affluent citizens .
Anything which makes voting more difficult they figure will reduce the number of voters going to the polls to vote for Democrats .
I do n't have a problem with the first two - provided that they make available photo IDs at no cost to people with limited income and allow clear instructions and make it easy to obtain ( in other words - there are many locations to obtain and enough hours that are varied enough to get these ids ) .
I support having IDs to limit voter fraud , but you cannot make it difficult and it should be economically feasible for all to get an ID .
I mean if you make the extra effort to go out and vote - it should n't be much more a burden to get an ID .
The Democrats must return to their progressive program , and must spend the resources necessary to remind the people that the GOP , the right wing , the Tea Party are just plain wrong on the issues .
Hopefully the Massachusetts loss has made Obama go back on the progressive track .
What is interesting about the 2 party system is the people never actually vote FOR a party .
They always vote AGAINST THE OTHER ONE .
The net result is the people are misrepresented 100 % of the time - but amazingly they are so dumb they ca n't figure it out .
We asked you : To save money , should local governments use nonviolent inmates for physical labor ?
That was the question in the other day 's opinion section of my my local newspaper .
YES : 92.6 % NO : 7.4 %
So my qestion is this , should gov't turn to slaves to save money ?
@David cv , Depending on country it is already done .
Hard labour , chaingangs , prison farms Voluntary work while incarcerated gets minimal pay etc
The option as voluntary will at least not require quotas and enforcement through violent means ( beatings ) or witholding of priveledges like food , bedding ( yes bedding ) or outdoor sunlight and isolation . ( legislativ brutality encouragement )
The question is what kind of work is beneficial in a crime and punishment related way .
Some experiements are already implemented in disaster relief bushfires / floods , comunity work as replacement for incarceration . ( Anti social behaviour treatment )
It really depends on the moral standards of the Nation in question .
Forced labour in Europe compared to Africa or America is implemented differently
Have'nt goverments / corporations turned their populus trough a monetary reward / tax system into working slaves anyway ?
what 's your thoughts on this ?
i mean , the guy is 88 years old .
Is it really necessary after all these years ?
he 's been here since 1955 and never did a thing to any one .
being a nazi was what was expected of germans back then .
you and i , had we lived there during that time , would probably have been in the same boat .
The head of the OSI is named Rosenbaum , what do you expect ?
While I disagree with you that we 'd all be Nazis , it was over 60 years ago , and the man has obviously reformed .
Expelling him was a political move to strengthen the Zionist stance through a reminder of the holocaust , and serve as a talking point for the anti - Ahmadinejad crowd .
So I was discussing that new tv show on ABC , Commander in Chief , with my grandfather .
He made a comment that was interesting , he said , " That show is just the liberal media trying to get us used to the idea of a woman president for when Hillary runs . "
Now , my grandfather is one of those old , cynical guys that thinks that every sports game that does n't go his way is fixed , and is a tad racest , however , I found the statement intrigueing and made me wonder .
What are your guys ' opinions ?
I 've definitely heard that argument before , and I refuse to watch the dang show .
Ok so I live in MI and maryjane was just legalized in our state .
Well all know why a state would legalize it , but do you really think that it can help somebody ? If so why ?
Think of any other drugs that you feel may help someone .
Think of this . When I was doing crystal , I was in school .
I never missed a day of school .
When I went to my classes tweaking , I paid more attention to what was going on in class .
I went home did ALL of my homework .
I remember lookin at one of my report cards before I started using and my grades were either all d 's or d 's and f 's .
Then I looked at a report card that I got that had ALL a 's on it .
I was soo high on crystal that semester that I do not even remember most what happened at school or at home .
So I ask do you think drugs can be good for some people ?
I know that no matter what no drug is good for anyone .
This does n't mean that I would go back and change things if I could , because I really do not want to .
I am just wondering how other people feel about this .
@secondchance , I think that drugs can have positives but I think that they 'll rarely come without negatives and whether or not it 's a net positive is hard for anyone to tell , most of all the user .
@secondchance , it is possible to self medicate to a positive outcome . responsible use is required .
For instance a couple of generations of artists have widely used drugs , convinced that the change in consciousness is of great help to their work .
We moderns have no doubt but that it is a good idea to drug people up on Ritalin and anti anxiety drugs and antidepressants , this highly drugged society has no basis to complain about weed and coke .
Meth though messes people up big time , so I do n't see a lot of upside to that .
Yes , and I 'm one of them .
My life would be impoverished without my daily glass of wine .
I quite enjoyed the few joints I have tried .
And sometime , when I 'm in a better general mood than I am right now , I 'd like to try LSD or one of its relatives , maybe magic mushrooms .
To me , consuming drugs is a matter of moderation , not abstinence .
My wife has Constant ringing in her ears
Any ideas ? THANKS
@RobC , That 's tinnitus .
She should see an otorhinolaryngologist ( ear specialist ; ear , nose and throat specialist ) as , if this is recent , there may be things they can do .
I just watched the most fascinating , inspiring , and yet heartbreaking documentary : The Half Ton Man .
Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions in the world today .
Is there a fat gene ?
Science seems to think there is .
Many people feel hungry every minute they are awake and fight the fact they know they are literally killing themselves with every bite they take .
One man in the documentary lost 706 pounds !
Yet , when he reached 198 pounds he celebrated by having a hot dog , which turned into two , three , etc.
He now is morbidly obese again and is n't ready to go back into rehab at a center that has great success in helping these people .
When I was younger I could eat virtually anything and not gain weight .
I 'm almost 52 and it 's not quite that easy for me to keep my weight to what is comfortable for me .
I am able to do it , but watching this video scared me . One woman in the video was actually eight feet wide when she got help .
I have seen shows on TV where two year old children weigh nearly 200 pounds all because their parents want to appease the child and stop their fussing .
Does anyone out there have a big problem with their weight ?
How do you combat it ?
Is food an addiction ?
Is over - eating a disease like drug addiction or alcoholism ?
Now , THAT 'S a link ! LOL
I think the problem and cure is psychological . They should spend more time on the psycology of it coupled with the surgery .
Oh , now there getting into that part .
I watched that documentary on Patrick Deuel a while back .... too bad he 's gained some weight back .
But there 's always hope he 'll get back on track .
Besides the obvious medical issues with him , I was disturbed by the co - dependant relationship with his wife .
At his worst , he weighed 1,072 pounds .
He was unable to even roll over in bed , let alone get to the refrigerator or supermarket ....
he could n't even get to a phone or a computer to order food if you put it 10 feet away from him .
So .... who was feeding his all that crap ?
Who was bringing it to him ?
She feels she 's showing love by bringing him to deaths door because he asked for ( or begged or ranted ) for food .
And not just food .... garbage .
I understand love for your spouse , but theirs is not a healthy relationship .
Also , in the video , after he had gotten under 500 pounds , Patrick said " I avoid foods with a lot of fat and sodium " .... as he was snacking on individual size bags on salted nuts and potato chips .
In the scene before that ( after his gastic bypass and much weight loss ) , the wife brought him dinner .... Kentucky Fried Chicken .
" Oh " , she said , " Here 's your protein " , as she waved an extra crispy drumstick at him .
My husband loves egg sald .
When I make it , I through out 4 out of the 12 yolks , and mix in a pound of tofu .... he never knows the difference .
( BTW , he 's very thin , but has a heart condition ) .
Wifey could maybe take some lessons from me .
Doctors have told me I have a full thickness rotator cuff tear and must have surgery or my shoulder will freeze .
Looking for information from anyone who has had it or with someone recuperating .
I have heard the recovery is brutally painful .
Any tips , suggestions , etc. , about what to expect during first few days , how to manage , sleep , any info .
I had it done three years ago at Johns Hopkins .
I had suffered low grade " bursitis " in one shoulder for many years ( probably a worn rotator cuff ) , until one day while working out I got a real , full tear .
Lots of serious pain with some movements or any strenuous exertion .
My surgery was successful , but it took me several months to regain my range of motion in the shoulder .
I learned that the post op therapy is probably more critical than the surgery itself .
I was determined to restore the range of motion and to return to my old exercise routine , so I in effect took charge of the rehab program and made it clear to the therapist the Orthopedic Surgeon that I would n't accept less .
In retrospect I believe this was the critical thing , in that the Docs . and the therapists take their cues from the patient -- if you passively accept less than full recovery , they will let you go .
If you are determined to go on , they will help .
I have full use of the shoulder and no more pain .
I would do it again .
I hope this is helpful and wish you good luck !
I 'm under erratic , severe stress in my personal life and my colorful , efficient adrenalin glands are playing merry hell with my blood pressure .
I 'm hoping to avoid drugs by losing weight and learning serenity , but meanwhile I 'm supposed to monitor my blood pressure at home .
Once upon a time I had a jim - dandy wrist unit that worked perfectly .
Then after 7 years of faithful service , it up and died .
Now the wrist units at the local drugstores come with a read - outbox that is too wide for my 5 1/2 inch wrist .
I 've also tried the wrap - the - upper arm monitors .
These only work about 20 % of the time and dealing with them sends my blood pressure up to new heights .
Also , because of a lumpectomy I can only use my left arm for B.P. readings .
I 'm left handed , but am making progress in non - dominent - hand dexterity .
Can anyone recommend a no - hassle , Luddite - friendly home blood pressure monitor that will work around bird bones ?
Noddy , from your post I assume you have not checked on the models currently on the market .
Most companies have fully automatic models that do n't require adjusting it to your arm with every use .
You adjust it once to fit your arm ( You can do this with it off your arm ; it might take two tries ) and that 's that .
Slip it on your arm . Press a button and in less than a minute read your B.P. and heart rate .
I 've had an Omron for three years and have never had a problem .
I think it cost in the vicinity of $ 50 - $ 60 .
You can get them a bit cheaper if you are willing to pump it up yourself .
The semi - automatic that I have does the pumping for you .
As I sit here foggy headed and lets face it with most of the symptoms of hypoglycemia I thought I should do something about it .
Im trying to start to eat healthily , slowly but surely , which means cutting out processed foods and eating more natural things .
A good start to begin with but not necessarily dealing with hypoglycemia .
It says give up things like caffiene , tobacco , things I dont consume anyway , it says give up wheat , which is bread , which I tend to eat alot of .
I assume we all do , it kind of houses all the other ingredients we need like in sandwiches or wraps , pizza .
Basically does anybody have any advice on what to eat or recomend a good book ?
Search out a glycemia index , and determine something both edible and low on the list .
Add that to your diet , to avoid getting into hypoglycemia .
If it happens anyway , skim ( non fat ) milk will raise the blood sugar about as fast as anything .
Indulge in a light bedtime snack , again , something fairly low on the list .
Do n't overdo it , though .
i have not yet been diagnosed but i am beginning to suspect hypoglycemia / low blood sugar .
lately i have been very confused , have anxiety , dizziness , fatigued , weak , depressed , and generally low .
i know i need to gain more weight - i lost about 20 pounds suddenly about 6 months ago and have n't been able to gain it back .
how does a doctor diagnose someone with this ?
what tests should i have them run ?
I have been reading about FluMist , the new flu vaccine that is administered intranasally .
One thing that I noticed , is that it is marketed as suitable for people ages 5-49 .
I have not seen any material as to why the 50 + population is unsuitable for this vaccine .
Anybody know why ?
Well , according to that FDA link children between 5 and 17 are the most likely to actually get the flu itself and it looks like that was the intended target age group for the development of FluMist .
They note that it is 87 % effective in preventing people in that range from getting the flu at all but people in the 18-49 range only had lessened symptoms .
It seems the older the patient the less effective the drug .
It is inconceivable that you take a multivitamin in good faith and it wrecks havoc on your health in such a profound way but that is the case .
I " was " taking a Centrum multivitamin once a day as suggested on the back label and I was waking up with dry mouth so sever I could not even swallow .
My skin was getting scaly , my eyes burning and my feet were so dry they begin to develop calluses and crack .
I stopped my vitamin and it is now gone .
WHAT IS UP CENTRUM ?
It is not just Centrum but any type of multivitamin causes this .
If you search the internet for " dry mouth and multivitamin " you get this idiot named " Jade M " on Google answers that replies that it is " not likely " that a multivitamin is causing this dryness of nearly every cell in the body .
Sorry to say Jade M whoever you are but you are WRONG ...
If you do n't know what you are talking about you should n't be doling out incorrect information in an online medical forum .
My sister is a nurse at a veterans hospital and she complained to her doctor that she was getting dry mouth .
He told her that it was her multivitamin and she cut down her intake of the multivitamin and her dry mouth left completely .
A friend of mine who takes many medications for his heart just came up to me and told me he was getting terrible dry mouth at night and reduced his multivitamin to only a few times a week and now no more dry mouth .
In other words if you follow the directions on the back label of your vitamins they will start slowly killing you .
Do n't expect Paul G. Donohue M. D. to help you either .
He basically dismisses this elderly persons claim then tries to get her to take corrective medications .
How typical ...
I get dry mouth too plus my skin gets dry and scaly and when I stop my multivitamin it immediately goes away .
Now this is four completely unrelated people all coming to the exact same conclusion .
Not only can we not trust the general consensus on the internet but we cannot trust people who have PHD credentials giving their advice online .
What do we have to dry up and die before we finally figure out what ails us ?
When my sister told this to me I did not really give it much thought .
Then I permanently lost 10 % of my eyesight due to dry eyes .
Then my mouth chronically became dry , skin kept piling up on my feet that I could n't sand it off fast enough to keep up with it , the skin on my hands became scaly and my lips kept cracking and my tongue felt like it had pins and needles poking into it .
I stop the multivitamin and my mouth symptoms are gone , sadly my eyesight is still damaged .
I should have just listened to my sister rather than err , Jade M.
My doctor was even prescribing fish oil supplements to correct the dry skin problem which could not even put a dent in the problems being caused by my multivitamin .
I do n't consume a lot of salt in my diet and I am on no other medications or drugs whatsoever .
If you are experiencing dry mouth and take a multivitamin stop the vitamin immediately before you ruin your health irreversibly .
Take it only a few times a week , if that , and you will realize the vitamins cause this .
I was also told by a pharmacist that other than the antioxidants , a person gets what they need from their diet of most minerals and do not require a multivitamin at all .
So a strictly antioxidant formula is all that is required minus the multivitamin minerals .
Please weigh in on this , sorry I am upset about this but I am also troubled now by internet advice that is clearly WRONG about this issue and no telling how many others .
Tinnitus , vision loss , global cellular degeneration , moisture loss , and even constipation are all caused by general use of multivitamins .
Also if you are feeding your children multivitamins you should be highly cautious of this too .
Even children should only be given a multivitamin a few times a week and not every day .
They should be explained the dangers of regular use of vitamins ( in other words following the prescribed dosage ) .
Take it from me who has experienced this first hand , my sister who is a nurse , my friend taking many meds whose dry mouth stopped the very day he cut down on his multivitamin and L.F who was incorrectly advised by , err , Donehue .
It is a sad commentary that people have to collectively learn this on their own and that doctors , health specialists and the internet are so out of the loop .
Consider that vitamin waters and health food drinks on top of a multivitamin only compound this problem .
I forget what my sister said was causing this , I seem to recall zinc , but I may be wrong about that .
I have to ask her again .
Consider if it is visibly destroying your skin it is also destroying your major organs too .
Please comment and offer any further advice on this subject .
I just started on a new kind of multivitamin and my body 's been all kinds of crazy .
I used to just take specific vitamins but that got expensive and elaborate and I was missing some things so I switched to a multi .
The multi has calcium and I know from previous experience that calcium tears my stomach up .
I 'm getting older and I know that I need some calcium though .
I do n't have dry mouth but I agree that multivitamins can have unintended consequences .
I have been taking high potency multivitamins for almost twenty years .
I have not know any side effects .
One thing , though is to not have certain foods too close to the time of the taking , because certain ones can interact .
For instance , I am taking something now that advises to not take regular vitamin C for an hour on either side of taking that product .
It suggests discontinuing the 12 hour release of Vitamin C for as long as that product is being used .
I have to constantly make such comparisons to make sure it all works .
I am on very high dose vitamin C , besides my green multiple , that is very concentrated compared top wimpy Centrum .
I never had dry mouth until this high dose of C , so I am assuming it is the C.
I use it as an antihistamine to control my IBS .
I have overactive mast cells that start pulling water into my gut when i run out of C and Magnesium ( this I think was caused by taking a round of vaccines in 2003 , and the studies I found online confirm that mercury in the adjuvants often do cause increased histamine production ) .
So I am on 4000-6000mg of C 4X daily and 400-600 mg Magnesium 4 x Daily .
This is a lot , but I have learned it does control my bowels .
The normal person would get colon blow from these doses , and it firms me up to normal .
This is ultimately an adrenal issue , as the adrenals are throwing out huge amounts of electrolytes and I am sure other stuff , so until I realized this I was in constant loose bowels losing my nutrients .
But it HAS caused dry mouth .
I do n't think it is as bad as some I have read here .
There are some archaelogists who believe that two sites in Syria could be the world 's earliest cities .
Tell Brak and Tell Hamoukar in the NE of Syria may have existed back in 3700BC .
Seems plausible .
Damascus is generally considered to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world .
It 's mentioned by name in Genesis as a place where Abraham stopped on his way to Canaan from Ur of the Chaldees ( in modern - day Iraq ) .
According to this , American citizens can now be arrested and detained indefinitely without trial .
Does that mean that anyone can be taken and put into a hole forever without justification ?
If so , I think it 's scary .
But who decides that the person was actually a member of or working for Al Qaeda ?
What court can review that decision ?
Well , the verdict just came in .
Guilty of involuntary manslaughter .
The judge would not let him be released until sentencing either .
The judge said his behavior was wreckless and the community could be in harm 's way . ( Not his exact words ) .
I am glad he is losing his license .
No matter what , he never should have given Michael Jackson that propofol .
The man practiced here for many years .
The local TV news is running nothing but outrage over the conviction .
Not one word in favor of it .
The local ABC channel featured a legal expert who derided the trial , calling it a travesty , making doctors afraid to treat patients and so forth .
He seems to think a " proper " court would have let Murray go free .
An increasing proportion of US children are so severely obese as to be at immediate risk for life - threatening complications including type 2 diabetes .
Some will become candidates for treatment at newly established pediatric surgical weight loss programs throughout the country .
As an alternative approach , involvement of state protective services might be considered , including placement into foster care in carefully selected situations .
Ultimately , government can reduce the need for such interventions through investments in the social infrastructure and policies to improve diet and promote physical activity among children .
Severe obesity in children -- is that a form of child abuse ?
Should the state step in and save these kids from their parents ?
David ... you 're so not looking at the big picture .
If this current trend continues , a whole generation or two will be lost .
Considering that we are globally competing against India and China who so far DO N'T suffer this epidemic , we will fall farther behind in almost every aspect .
These next generations will become a major burden on our health care system .
Prevention is needed now not later when it will most likely NOT work .
Cheaper to fix it now then to let it cripple the entire economy at a later date .
I live in CA and I signed an affiliation agreement 12/09 which states that I was to pay a monthly fee to the owners .
The owners said " NOT " to pay until my business had picked up .
Although my business is struggling , I have tried several times to start paying this fee .
Each time the owners said " NO " do n't worry about .
We have now parted ways , for both personal and professional reasons , and now they are taking me to small claims court for the affiliation fee they said I did n't have to pay plus their legal fees ( I am being bullied ) .
Has anyone dealt with a situation like this ?
I thought a verbal agreement would override a written agreement , but is that hard to prove ?
I mean obviously the proof is that they are suing me for back fees that I have not been paying because business has been slow .
Please , help or share your story .
It sounds like there is more than what you have posted .
Did you break a lease or agreement with them ?
Leave early ?
It sounds like they were waiving certain fees , with the understanding that you were going to stay for the long haul .
If you left early , then they now want all their fees .
A written agreement trumps a verbal agreement .
A written agreement is hard proof .
Without that it 's your word against their word .
You should have put the money is escrow if you felt uncomfortable with the arrangement .
My newspaper has an article today on animal hoarders , listing some signifigant recent cases :
One woman lived on an old school bus with 117 dogs , 4 cats and 2 chickens .
One man had 500 dogs .
Another had 80 cats .
Two weeks ago , animal services confiscated 39 cats living with a man in a van .
Most hoarders live in unimaginable filth .
( I did n't want to post the photos because they are really gross . )
Most of these people are charged with animal abuse and neglect and they are fined and jailed .
Do you think these people are criminals ?
i watched animal planet ( way too late at night this weekend ) and saw a florida animal cops .
They busted a hoarder with 82 dogs and confiscated 78 of them ( i think legally in fla you can have 4 ) .
The dogs were in such bad shape , some could n't walk because their nails were so long , most were flea infested and had been sleeping in their own feces .
there were two sets of puppies in the house and as they panned around the house , it appeared that there were at least two other sets of puppies in the making .
the woman was not prosecuted as long as she was willing to give up the amount needed to take her back to the legal limit .
and they checked up on her after that .
apparently the media ran a story about it and over 40 dogs were adopted the first day they were available .
i go for mentally ill as well , but like freeduck said , sometimes the only way to get them treatment is to prosecute .
They just told this woman they would keep checking up on her ( randomly so she could n't hide pets like she was when they were rounding them up ) and as long as she had only 4 , she was fine .
that seems reasonable to me since no dogs were dead , no dogs were starving , they just needed more attention .
it was a much better story than the dog chained to a tree for 3 weeks in florida heat that finally succumbed ... made me cry .
now those people should be tied to a tree with no food and water and see how they do ...
We had our own local " cat lady " who made the newspaper headlines a couple of decades ago .
She lived in a filthy , almost uninhabitable house surrounded by cats , cats , cats .
Many people tried to help her , but she made it impossible for anyone to give her effective assistance even in the face of having her home condemned .
And that 's what eventually happened .
Her house was declared a public nuisance and the city tore it down .
I 'm pretty sure this old lady had more than just a few screws loose .
I saw her many years ago at a local supermarket .
She was wearing a drab winter coat and a large colorful scarf around her head with her unkempt gray wig hairs sticking out .
She was slumped against a wall and the store personnel had called an ambulance .
It was a pathetic sight .
I think it is a kind of depression myself , where one lets go of a lot of effort to keep up with daily life except to ' care ' for animals , and then is overwhelmed but sees no way out of it - except that they do , I gather , start again .
A kind of compulsion .
Not that I do n't want them stopped .
Is this a kind of ocd ? a pre - alzheimers ?
There is something to be said for humane institutional care , and I am not talking about the dogs .
Tricky subject , on which I can see several sides .
Please - this is NOT a thread about the case , as such , I find those threads concerning - BUT about some of the differences between the American , and some other countries ' practices - and their effect .
For instance : i ) In Australia , and , I believe , Great Britain at the very least , the name of a juvenile involved in a criminal matter is not revealed , whether they be alleged victim , or alleged perpetrator , except in very special circumstances
( eg they have been kidnapped , and police seek public help to find them - or they have been murdered - or if they are alleged to have committed a very serious crime and are being tried as adults , or if it is in some way in the public interest . )
To these non - US eyes , it is very shocking to see the name and photograph of the young man alleged to have been abused by Jackson splashed all over the media -
here , juveniles are protected to the point that , on the few occasions I have accompanied a minor who was raped or sexually abused to court , while she / he gave testimony - if the offender ( these were cases where , oddly , a conviction was obtained , so I do not say " alleged " offender ) was also a minor , it was a big deal to be allowed in to be a support person for the victim , because I would hear the name of the offender .
What do people think of the US practice ?
What is the reason for it ?
Which would you prefer ?
What do you think is the impact on young people so identified ?
ii ) The media circus .
Here , both defence and prosecution are very limited as to what they can say about a case that is before the courts . The matter is considered sub judice .
Occasionally , with high profile cases , the police will " leak " things - and / or the media will attempt , within the letter of the law , to try a case in the media ( the Lindy Chamberlain case was a terrible example of both these occurrences ) -
but the organised propaganda campaigns that I think I detect in the US are not generally present .
Full details are generally releasable only after the trial .
Again , the spectacle is very shocking to these non - US eyes .
I presume it is allowed because of an interpretation of free speech ?
Do people think it aids justice ? That it is societally positive ? What do you think ?
iii ) This is unrelated - but , do people think this is going to be another black v white case , and do you think that high profile non - Caucasian people still - despite their wealth and power - are unfairly treated in the US justice system ?
I would think that , similarly to here , that poorer and obscure people of colour would tend to be - but I am interested in views re people who have achievedfame and fortune .
Judging the US legal system based on what goes on in , say , the Jackson case is probably a bad idea .
I 've served on jury duty several times and came away highly impressed with how seriously everybody took their various responsibilities .
A case like Jackson 's , alas , or the Kobe Bryant case betray many standards .
The media have some role in this , as do glory - hounding attorneys on both sides .
I 'm sure , for example , that a minor 's name should never be publicized in a case like this .
I 'm trying to pay as little attention to this case as possible , because I think it 's more a freak show than anything else .
Please do n't judge our system on the basis of the Jackson trial !
We have very strict publication bans around identity of abused minors in Canada .
The person charged often cannot be identified , as their name , and the details of the relationship to the child , would mean the child could possibly be identified .
Sleeping next to the elephant means we 've probably become a bit jaded to the circus . But the laws are much tighter here .
I would be extraordinarily happy not to make such a judgment , D'Artagnan !!!! But - it is ALLOWED to happen !
Would the name of the child , for instance , normally be suppressed ?
How often do cases become media circuses ?
I guess what I am getting at is the different LAWS on such matters ...
Interesting to have such differences in the systems of countries that grew so similarly , ehBeth .
We seem much more like you guys - but , I suppose , the US invented its laws after a revolution - we inherited them after centuries of slow evolution with no cataclysm , and made changes slowly .
I think but I 'm not completely sure if you can print any name of a sexual abuse victim in Canada without the express permission of the victim .
You cannot print the name of any minor whether the victim or perpetrator of any crime , except in very special / rare circumstances where a minor is at large and a suspected danger to the community or themselves .
A court order is needed in these cases and once the minor is apprehended the name and or picture must not be printed again , ever .
News outlets are rarely allowed to print anything specific in these cases as well .
In cases of family abuse the names are rarely printed , if ever , in order to protect the victim .
I had no idea the victim in the Jackson cases was publicized .
I have seen pictures of his previous victim which I though was pretty appalling but generally the faces have been smudged out .
What I hope will happen here is that people will come along to present the case FOR allowing the names to be made public , because it is incomprehensible to me -
but there MUST be reasons for the US system to be the way it is on these matters .
It is n't as though people in the US are not interested in and critical of their own system - gotta be a reason ...
I think they are getting ready to bring the first miner up .
Over 2,000 feet up , in a little tube , through a little tunnel .
On CNN I saw a picture they showed of the faces of the miners , and I saw at least a couple guys that look way too big to fit in that thing .
I guess they 'll be sucking in their guts .
Wow , 69 days .
That 's like a full season of Big Brother .
I guess the whole rescue is supposed to take about two days , if their estimates are correct and nothing goes wrong .
And the whole thing will be watched live all over the world .
Here 's a place where there are some livestreams if you want to check it out .
Americans could learn a lot from the Chilean people as the 33 miners are rescued .
They came together to support and save the miners ' lives .
So much better than the political party fighting going on over the coming elections in the U.S.
I have a question .
The last man , one of the rescuers , must be able to lock the rescue tube 's door correctly from the inside ?
I can understand how he could hook up the oxygen pack and other devises , but I ca n't figure out how he can lock the door so it does n't come loose if no one is there to do it from the outside .
he will have to hold it shut with a handle or maybe a bungee cord held on the inside .
Good question .
Looks like these guys are gonna get out in time to do their Christmas Shopping
I am sorry ; but I thought Chili was part of America ...
One of them at least ...
They come in two 's you know ... Inner Mongolia , and outer Mongolia ... That sort of thing ...
In any event , I do not know the answer to your question ...
It would seem that for most doors , there is a handle on the inside and the outside ...
Just like Hammers have claws so you can go both ways with a nail ...
Speaking from experience , it is damned difficult some times not having reverse on a motor cycle ...
You ca n't stop riding without thinking about riding later ...
Here I am , and how do I get out ..
I 'm watching on the telly yet another shooter ( Orlando Fla ) news says 8 victims taken to hospital .
You know what David is going to tell you in a few minutes : if the others had guns to protect themselves , they all would be dead by now .
That 's how gun logic works , my dear dys .
Guess all the gun crazy psychotics are flipping out of the woodwork .
yeah , and then I 'm a gun owner .
And your " " " " enlightened " " " " solution is ?
my " enlightened " solution is for everyone to determine who might become a potential shooter and kill them before they are able to harm anyone .
Does my sarcasm equate adequately to yours ?
I 'm talking specifically about the showing of the contents of the package that he sent to NBC .
I realize that this stuff will probably come out anyway , and that the public really REALLY wants to see what was in that package , but is n't it also in a way glorifying / validating the guy 's actions and giving him exactly what he wanted ?
For instance , the image of him pointing a gun at the camera is on just about every news site I see online , and the video clips of his rantings are starting to show up everywhere as well . And his writing .
I realize how fascinating it is to try to get inside this nutball 's head , but is there any way to put the news out there about him without giving him rock star status ?
Is it even possible ?
I wonder how long until this stuff shows up on murderauction.com or one of those other disgusting sites .
I think there can be details ( what happened when , who tried to do what , etc. ) without spreading his own propaganda . Because that 's what it is .
He stage - managed this -- he wanted the badass stuff out there , he wanted that lasting image .
Just show a small picture of who he was , the original one was fine .
The rest is unnecessary , and articles BBB and nimh have linked to argue convincingly that the propaganda is downright dangerous .
The American public has reached the point in our culture , that the news that gets the most coverage is the news that plays to the lowest common denominator amongst us .
Think about it . For weeks , there was Pamela Anderson and the baby . Then it was Don Imus . Now all we hear about is that murderous nutjob who acted on his sickest delusions .
It is like the newspapers and TV want to beat out the supermarket rags . Ugh !
I 've been enjoying the NYTimes blog , primarily by Michael Kimmelman , who I 'm used to reading when he writes about art .
But he 's joined by several other good writers who are apparently hanging around the US Open typing away as they feel like it .
I like all the different viewpoints .
Have always like Vecsey 's writing , but ca n't read him in the paper lately because he 's now in the Times Select group that you have to pay for to get access to , even on the day of the article .
My favorite writer on the blog is Kimmelman , he seems to have my eyes , if I had his .
I 'm enjoying the play by play , as it were , so much that I want to see if I can go back and read the blog on the World Cup .
Probably not , as so much time has passed .
Anybody on a2k following this ?
Going to the matches ?
I do follow international tennis -- one of the first things I want to glance over on the morning newspaper .
Not going to the matches , though ?
Well , so are you following the US open ( http://www.usopen.org/ ) ?
Who are your fave players ?
Yeah , she sure was a tennis prodigy .
She 's always lacked the killer serve that is a key to today 's power game , though .
If she did n't have it in her heyday , she 's not going to have it now in the twilight of her career .
Hey , hope your day is going well !
I have a question for anyone who feels that want to answer .
I have been watching a bit of ' Rhythmic Gymnastics ' on YouTube ... I just find it amazing ... it 's very cool .
I do n't have children , but when I get to that stage , I 'd love a daughter of mine to take part in this really cool sport .
My question though is , is it true or just a myth that while all this crazy flexibility at a young age is nice , at old age they will be in pain and not able to move at all ?
If it is true , I 'd prefer not to have any part in it , but if it 's not true , it would be great to know .
Can anyone help ?
I 'm no expert , but Nadia Comenechi , the famous Romanian gymnast , has no health problems from her gymnastics days though her former gymnast husband is wracked with arthritis .
Thanks for you quick reply .
Could it be that different people react to it in different ways ?
Maybe you just enjoy it while you do , and if you find it painful afterwards ... bad luck , if not ... GREAT !
Has anyone else got any other thoughts ?
I 'm not familiar with rhythmic gymnastics , but I know both gymnasts and dancers are prone to on - the - job injury -- and the effects of those injuries can add up .
The behaviour of Australian cricket fans is of more concern than the thousands of spirited Barmy Army members set to descend upon our shores for this summer 's Ashes series , say Victoria 's police .
The number of English fans travelling to Australia is expected to easily surpass the 10,000 who came for the 2002-03 Ashes series because of last year 's victory and because of an online ticketing fiasco that saw thousands of English fans nabbing Ashes tickets meant for Australians .
There has been some discussion here about the Ashes .
Not the test series , the actual ones .
Apparently the Aussies ( a devious lot ) have said that when they win the series ( that 's IF they do , but they do n't think that way ) they want to take the small urn from its permanent place at Lord 's Cricket Ground back to Oz.
MCC say , on your bikes Cobber , because that urn is a gift , not a trophy , and it stays where it is .
What say the Aussies now ?
I 'm sitting here pulling my hair out because my roomate is watching the Masters on TV . I 'd rather drink battery acid than watch golf .
Why the hell do golfers escape that aspect ? The pressure and ability to block stuff out adds to the challenge . Why are they so special ?
I love golfing .
Do n't understand watching it .
Also do n't understand courses that use carts .
None of that new - fangled crap for me .
Walk , and carry your bloody clubs .
so there are others out there other than myself that hate golf and believe its not a sport ? thats wonderful !
golf is a sport ... an incredibly boring sport ...
tennis players get the same ' silent treatment ' from spectators -- not exactly sure why ...
Bite me , Slappy .
Hatred of golf is for people with brain deficiencies .
One other thing that must annoy you . In all other sports ( yeah , golf is a sport ) ... there are refs and umps and all that . And the people playing the sports argue with those officials all the time .
In golf ... you gotta call fouls on yourself . And golfers do !
There ai n't nothing in the world better than golf . ( Well ... maybe one thing . But even that , you can eventually get enough of . You can never get enough of golf . )
Will Tom ever return to the Pats ?
Ever ? Yeah , next season .
It 's looking like he is out for the year , though depedning on his rehabilitation , he may try to be available for the playoffs .
It 's tough to say though .
My money is on Brady to return next year .
I do n't think he 's willing to let the previous season 's Super Bowl be his last .
Or it is possible you will stand there with a frozen grin on your face , unable to say anything remotely intelligent .
WE CAN HELP YOU !
Several of us A 2K'ers have created a support group to painlessly guide you towards appearing knowledgeable even if , like many of us , you are clueless .
They are called the Wildcard games .
You will need to invest a grand total of 7 minutes . Total . Max.
Please indicate , by noon on Saturday , Jan 8th , your picks on these 4 games :
NY Jets @ Indianapolis Colts
Baltimore Ravens @ Kansas City Chiefs
New Orleans Saints @ Seattle Seahawks
Green Bay Packers @ Philadelphia Eagles
The Jets aggravated me no end in Fantasy Football ( Sanchez was my quarterback ) , so this seems to me a perfectly good reason to pick the Colts , who also aggravated me , but not as much .
I 'm placing my faith that the Jet 's defense will kick in one more time .
Plus I like it that no one else seems to have faith in the Jets .
Besides this wild card round is just fodder for the real games when the Patriots start playing and ultimately take the whole burrito , ( enchiladas are n't classy enough for Tom Brady and the gang ) .
Instead of a coin toss - and because I know absolutely nothing about football - I 'm going to do it by which city I know / like better and see how well I do .
So my picks will be :
New York
Baltimore
New Orleans
Philadelphia
Just as an experiment to begin with , but I am fairly competititive in spirit , so if one of my teams makes it to the Super Bowl - I 'll watch it instead of the Andy Griffith show marathon and eat me some chicken wings and drink a beer or two .
Sounds fun to me ... ca n't hurt .
Is there a prize ?
in an article in toronto 's " globe and mail " newspaper , John Polanyi , a Nobel laureate and member of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Toronto , recommends that afghanistan farmers be allowed ( you might even say " be encouraged " ) to grow poppies ( opium ) legally .
he argues that there is a shortage of painkilling medication , particularly in poor , third world countries , and that afghanistan could supply the needed poppies at a lower price than commercially produced painkillers .
i saw the interview he gave on CBC - TV recently and he seems to know what he is talking about .
as he put it : " the afghan farmer has to make a living to feed his - often large - family .
we can force him to produce the poppies illegally and feed into the illegal drug market or we can buy the poppies from him and help provide pain - killing drugs . "
as i posted sometime ago , countries such as : france , australia and india are permitted to grow poppies legally for the production of drugs - why not allow the afghan farmers the same privilege ?
have a look at the article and see if you agree with him or not .
The problem with poppy cultivation is n't the growing of the crop itself .
The problem is oversight and marketing .
Opiates have legitimate medicinal uses .
Unfortunately , the product of the papver somniferum plant has far more monetary value on the black market than when sold to legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturers .
Thanks for the article and the background - I read both .
There would be problems though .
The criminal element that currently buy the crop are still going to try and get their hands on it , so the crops would need to be guarded .
That 's going to cost a fair bit and probably result in bloodshed .
Hottest world conflicts in the computer near you ! Live ! Entertaining ! Wild !
The future of the news reality shows , or whatever should one call it .
Kevin Sites touring the world 's conflict zones with digital technology that will allow him to blog and transmit images and videos from war ridden areas daily .
One can contact him there , or chat with him live on the website .
Now while I know he 's doing it voluntarily and probably for a shootload of money , I have to say I find the idea of such a project odd and somewhat disconcerning .
Will it start a new wave of journalists seeking out the most dangerous situations to sell their goods ?
Competition on who can go the farthest ?
And will that encourage the sides in conflict to up their performance , so to speak , getting international live coverage straight from the front ?
Especially if there will be more and more Keven Sites'es roaming the world ?
Thousands of journalists already do seek out war zones , sure .
But this is taking it to a whole new level , I think .
Anyway , I 'm confused about how I feel about it .
I will surely look in often to see where he 's at and will be curious about the reports and live videos .
It has a voyeuristic element to it , does n't it ?
Ah , what is this world coming to .
And what does the future of journalism hold for us ?
Can we control it in any way ?
What do you think ?
gus , that 's what 's making me uncomfortable .
it just seems like a stoopid idea to me .
but i wo n't deny that i am also curious , although it makes me feel kinda dirty .
partaking in making a violent conflict a part of entertainment culture .
well , more so than it already is . yecchh .
Everything in life has a positive , and a negative side .
The good thing about this is that they might be able to record what really is happening in certain areas of the world in case the governments of the world tell us different .
If they make money good for them !
If they survive many of these men come back home changed , and sometimes not for the better .
They could also come back wounded or sick .
To me , it 's a good thing to be able to choose how your going to die when it 's for a good cause .
There are incidents where the bastards in charge decide it would be best for a certain reporter to " die in conflict "
Mr. Sites better tread carefully .
Of course , I imagine he 'll have quite an entourage and that might ensure his safety from the more devious sorts .
The UN or at least some of the members threaten sanctions .
Sanctions , what sanctions could the UN impose , refuse to purchase the lifeblood of industry " OIL " ?
Iraq could on the other hand cut their production and cause the price of that commodity to go through the roof .
Is the threat of sanctions just another instance where the US and the UN is just blowing smoke ?
It 's blowing smoke as it 's the people who will end up suffering from any such move .
If the UN really wants to make a difference , they could threaten to pass a resolution !!!!!
Ooooooh ! That ought to scare ' em .... "
And Bush is clamering the loudest .
Does he , I wonder , think that would be his excuse to invade .
It would be WMD 's all over again .
I ca n't believe that even the crew that " owns " the US at the present time would do something as rash and ill conceived .
Let me start by saying that I love Morocco .
I 've been there a few times in the last 6 or 7 years and have become familiar with its people and customs and geography and unique challenges .
Each time I 've visited , I 've noticed immense , fast - paced progress , both economically and socially .
Since my first visit there a network of well - built highways has been built , enabling european and internal tourism and commerce to flourish .
I 've witnessed cell phones come on the market and virtually explode .
High speed internet is available .
House building and land development is through the roof .
Agricultural technology has taken off and enabled farmers to be profitable and efficient , as well as increasing the availability of affordable food to all Moroccans .
My aim for this thread is to periodically discuss new developments and economic initiatives in Morocco as they come about in the news , as well as any other news that is deemed curious or interesting .
I 'm interested in Morocco .
I know there are some cells there of folks who want to cause havoc but that is presumably not the whole population .
The country has seemed attractive to me for years .
At the least , I am interested in hearing more about it .
Don , could you be more specific about why Morocco is to be avoided ?
This all reminds me of myself sitting at a train station in italy at about 5:30 a.m. one morning .
My husband and I wandered in after buying our train tickets to get cappuccini and dolci before the ride ... and shared a table with two tourists from the US .
On my right was a table of what turned out to be moroccan laborers .
My xhub and the tourers were talking away about something and I glanced over at the ( moroccans ) and we started talking in poor italian , which is how I found out they were from Morocco .
Very polite sleepy early morning nice conversation .. I turned to the others and the lady said , " dear , you mus n't talk with them , they are dangerous . "
I ca n't remember what I said , but it was short , succinct .
That was a long time ago .
Not every immigrant from far away lands is the devil in disguise , and neither are all of us .
Well said , JLN !
I have n't been there myself but my 3 sons and a friend went a couple of years ago .
They said a ) it was one of the most beautiful places they had been and b ) it was the place in the world they had been most hassled and cheated .
I think , too , that as 4 young men travelling together , they were looked upon as a challenge by local youth .
They said there was fighting amongst kids in the street and this seemed to be normal and tolerated .
So it is a society with a very male testosterone - rich style .
The shops run by women were altogether less hassly , more friendly .
One thing they found particularly hard to deal with was other young men attaching themselves to their group and being undislodgeable ( a nwe word and it 's only 9 am ! ) .
My eldest who is especially friendly and tolerant tried to make friends with these people but in the end they all wanted something .
That can be dispiriting for the open - minded and open - hearted .
But they enjoyed their stay generally , would certainly not avoid it in future .
As for lumping all Islamic countries together as a no go area - what complete nonsense !
As we 're going to Turkey and Syria at the end of this month , and expect to have a wonderful trip as independent travellers , I am definitely making a political statement -
I do NOT lump all Muslims together , and believe that 98 % are friendly to travellers .
Most are undoubtedly anti - American and anti - Bush , but that is not a sentiment confined to the Islamists .
My engagement ring / wedding ring and other personal ring along with my husband 's wedding ring was stolen .
At least we assume so .
We went camping and put them together in the car .
After camping and coming home we searched high and low and could not find them .
We called the campgrounds and the owners said they had cleaned our campsite and did not find anything .
So we had to assume some one stole them .
We did have the car unlocked at times so it is a definate possibility .
Really stinks at it was just our anniversary right before .
Yep , that stinks .
We were robbed one time right before Christmas .
Came home , and the basement door had been kicked in .
All they took were wrapped Christmas gifts , and all of my husband 's socks .
Sounds funny now , but at the time I felt very violated at the thought of strangers going through my house .
@mags314772 ,
Yes I can say the one thing was at least it was n't in my house .
The idea of some one going through your house is as bad as them taking Christmas presents .
Wow , the Afghanis are in for a life - changing shock to their culture and way of life .
Tribal leaders , international corporations , international governments and bordering neighbors will all be vying with each other and the Afghani people for a piece of the action .
It will be interesting to watch who takes what sides .
Will China and Russia now side with the Taliban to take over the country and exploit the riches ?
Will the US help the Afghani people to learn from our mistakes and protect their natural environment from strip mining ?
Will Al Queda now return to the country to enrich themselves with the profits ?
Will the lithium deposits take away from efforts by Al Gore and others to invest in and invent research and development in improved battery storage for the very young renewable clean energy industry in the U.S ?
I dont think that any vast deposits found in one land that barely exists as a state and has almost no industry will be a setup for a despotic regime or a surge of TAliban takeover of provinces within which are these deposits .
SInce much of it lies in the mountainous regions of the West and southwest , these are already the subject of the new campaign against a resurfacing TAliban .
These minerals , especially the Lithium , will need major processing before its in a commercial state for batteries .
Long term development for all kinds of batteries for entire new gizmos ( not just blackberries ) will be based on better and better lithium cells .
Most of the worlds recoverable deposits lie in south America lake deposits and in our own western North Carolina in vast quartz deposits .
If they found deposits of rhodium and platinum itd be a major reason to enter negotiations to help em develop their resources .
You can have all the rear metals in the world in your country , but the supporting infrastructer 's must be in place , I.E. roads , power plants , process facilties , WATER , tons and tons of WATER , chemical suppliers , etc.
So what may appear as a rich mineral bonanza , will be shot down for now and the forseable future , because the cost of extraction , is larger that any profit margin .
The Administrative and Legislative branches of our government ca n't agree on how to make a dent in our deficits .
The solution ?
Go on vacation for a month and appoint a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives to try to work out some sort of plan .
Their mission is to reduce next year 's deficit by $ 1. 2Tn over the next 10 years .
They must come up with a plan by Thanksgiving - roughly 100 days - that 7 of the 12 members can agree on .
If they fail , there will be across the board cuts .
If they succeed , their plan must pass the House and the Senate with no alterations .
I , too , am skeptical , edgar .
The 3 Dems and 3 Repubs from the House seem to be intractably committed to their parties ' more extreme wings .
The Senators are being described as " dealmakers , " willing to compromise at the end .
We will have to see .
In the meantime , if any of you find biographies of the 12 members of the super committee , please link or write your own profile of them .
I 've said elsewhere that I do n't think they 're expected to accomplish anything .
They may put out a proposal but it will probably fail in one chamber or the other .
Neither chamber can come to consensus on substantive reforms , imo , and the triggers will be pulled .
The triggers were specifically chosen because each one is desirable to one party and not anethema to the other .
It never was a good idea and only seemed to be a good idea to the morons .
There was never any reason to think that this was going to work , and now that it will not they are going to try to defuse the trigger ... but THAT might not work either .
I dont know what the Vegas odds of gutting the defense department is but I put it at around 30 % .
It was always going to happen at some point , but maybe 10-20 years down the line , not now .
If this happens it will be a major breaking of faith with the American people .
Millions of Americans went to war for America , and came back broken or otherwise gave up a lot , and now we look to take a huge chunk of their hide because Washington no longer works .
This , folks , is going to be a problem .
EDIT : " delay and pray " has not worked in Europe , and it will not work in America .
In both places we see from our so called leaders a massive refusal to step up to the plate .
Bullshit !!! we are our own people .
The reason we are fighting the worlds wars is because the very rich who dont want to pay their share of taxes want the protection of the government for the wealth and jobs they have imported to other countries .
What the majority of the U.S citizens get in return is nothing but a lack of jobs and a reduction in our ability to feed our families .
Time to plug yourself in for a recharge , youre starting to run down .
If you wanna defeat Obama , seems to me you need a candidate with something between their ears .
All I see is Bozo and friends on the GOP side .
( Hint : Id vote for a republican if one of substance showed up , Im not too thrilled with the job Obama did .
I think he wasted his capital on the health care right at the beginning of the worst economic situation weve seen in our lifetimes .
UNFORTUNATELY , you cannot really think that any of the present gaggle of GOP candidates have got substance ) .
Thus the analysis that I have put up on A 2K in multiple places that the US Federal Government is corrupt , and is run by the corporate class .
We see the oppression of the people by the government in other areas besides economics though , for instance I have pointed out how this oppression is woven onto our sex law .
The oppressors should not get too comfy , as oppressors the world over are finding out they get over thrown by force of public will .
The oppressors of the American people will eventually suffer the same fate ...
Where is Theodore " Teddy " Roosevelt when we need him --- again ?
The greatest irony I 've seen here at a2k Hawkeye is although I agree with on the statement that the US is an oligarchy or a plutocracy I believe you have foolishly drunk the Kool - Aid to think the Tea Party is genuine in it 's pursuit to save the country from " our oppressors " when EVERY move they propose is a basic tenet to strengthen the status quo .
Clearly you are too blinded by your personal selfishness and greed to see and feel the rain falling on your head from your Tea Party overlords .
Governments exist for a reason .
Progressive governments exist and should continue to exist in order to protect it 's citizens from the raiding and looting hordes of the multibillion dollar conglomerates and banking institutions who themselves exist in order to set up a select small population into extreme wealth and power .
I am not of the Tea Party , I am a radical leftist formerly a revolutionary currently a socialist .
It could be argued that a better word is collectivist ...
I strongly support libertarian political actions because I want to see individuals once again free enough from government oppresion that they can choose to come together in collective effort .
What we have now is a sham socialism impossed by a government which is owned by the coporate class , whos only mission is to grab more wealth .
We are free from government oppression .
Now if we can free ourselves from our billion dollar overlords perhaps we can enjoy real freedom and get rid of our bought politicians .
The Euro countries are afraid to let Greece go bankrupt , because it will be followed by Spain and Ireland .
If that happens , the Euro 's value will drop to unimaginable levels , and inflation will hit all their countries .
The European Central Banks Euro policies continue to exacerbate the problems for Greece and the other Euro countries with huge deficits .
France and Germany are trying their best to prop up Greece with more loans and forgiving of loans , but that seems like a losing proposition when Greece really does n't have an economy that can pay back the loans they already have .
It seems like desperation times for the Euro zone countries , but the majority are in no position to assist Greece with their growing deficit .
How long will this plugging of holes in the dam last ?
Germany and France are in no position to save all of them when the water 's rush gets stronger by the month ( growing deficits ) .
Greece 's debt is 179 % of GDP .
How will they survive ?
I believe we 're on the rim of an economic maelstrom .
Greece is only the latest symptom of a financial disease that has become pandemic .
I believe that , too .
Rather like an individual who works hard , produces useful work , and saves for the future suddenly finding himself wiped out because of the acts of a central bank , somewhere .
You guys are depressing me .
Ca n't I just go back to blissful ignorance ?
After WWII , the recovery was fast .
There was pent up demand for everything after the war , because most civilians earned money building our war machines for four years , and there was hardly any consumer goods to buy .
Even food was put on rations .
What was " funny " to some degree was the " cheap " junk we imported from Japan , because Americans were ready to spend money .
I remember lighters from Japan were made from soda pop cans , and they must have sold millions of those .
It appears a global recession is on its way .
A bush league president and political party should never be near the steering wheel of the US economy .
Their reckless policies and ideology can only lead backwards to a 18th or 19th century society of robber barons and ideological cutthroats .
It 's too late ; we 've been a recession many months ago ; most families could not continue to live their lifestyles of a couple of years ago because food and fuel costs have increased to the point most could not keep up with those higher costs .
As family members lost their jobs and homes , many also lost their health insurance .
That 's a biggie for most families .
You can listen to our government about " not being in a recession , " but I see it different .
Some important cricket is going to be played out in the next coupla months :
Australia takes on SL ( or rather Australian spectators take on Murali ) ; India sweats it out with Pakistan ; SA prepare to face NZ .
There 's lots to talk about .
Would the Ozzies and Indians ( British are allowed , too ) want to talk over a beer or two ?
I 'm here !
Glad they gave Stuart McGill a run .
The New Year Test in Sydney is Aus vs India .
I went to the last Aus - India test .
We arrived , and the scoreboard read India 7-705 . Aarrggghhh !
I took a photo of it .
Was still a draw , though . Steve Waugh 's last Sydney Test .
Hope that does n't happen again !
AUSTRALIAN rock legend Billy Thorpe has died this morning after suffering a major heart attack overnight .
Thorpe , 60 , died in the early hours of the morning after he was rushed to Sydney 's St Vincent 's Public Hospital at 2am ( AEDT ) , a spokesman has said .
Did he do anything a non - Aussie may recognise ?
Billy moved to the US in 1976 .
Children of the Sun was released in 1979 Top twenty .
Billy headlined his own sold out tours through 1979 and 80 .
Sometime there abouts his record lable went belly up .
Polygram assumed the rights .
Lived as fast as he died .
At least in the early years .
They should have a one minute silence up at The Cross .
After strategically ' excising ' bits of Australia in order to thwart people smugglers ( you ca n't land in Australia if we pass a law to say it IS N'T Australia this week ) , our pint - sized PM has decided to think big .
How big .
Real big .
The Govt is planning to create a ' security zone ' that extends 1,000 nautical miles around the country .
This would allow the monitoring and possible interception of any vessel within the zone .
Amazingly , other nearby nations ( Indonesia for one ) are a bit put out as it extends Australian soverienty well into Sth East Asia .
And why ?
The USA has one ....
There must be some sort of international bench - mark for pissing off other nations in play here .
This Govt has also repeatadly said that it will take independent action to pre - emptively strike at ' terror ' and we are sourcing suppliers of cruise missiles .
Now , it is pretty obvious that Australia wo n't be attacked from the east ( NZ ) , the south ( Antarctica ) or the west ( big ocean then Madagascar ) .
So , ' security zone ' is shorthand for , ' You sneaky little brown people better not try any funny business ' .
Of course they just HAPPEN to be the most populous Muslim nation on Earth - of course we should always walk tall and talk tough when dealing with them .
Could you imagine how tough Washington would be if there was the ' Islamic Republic of Canada ' with a billion or more people sitting on their northern border ?
You will never ever appease Indonesia .
They could n't give a stuff about Australia no matter what we say .
They would have invaded us long ago if there was n't a big stretch of ocean in between .
If I were to describe accurately and succinctly my estimation of that post , australia , I might be banned .
I shall content myself by simply saying that you are utterly ignorant of where Stilly might have been , and what his experiences or feelings might be , nor do I see his whereabouts as forming the basis of any rational argument .
Perhaps fortunately , however , you have made no attempt to formulate any such argument .
Well was n't that progressive of them ...
This is the second time they 've done so .
The most amazing thing though is California , often described as the very heart of American liberalism , voted conservative on just about every one of the propositions out there .
They did approve assisted suicide , but I think voted against every other ' liberal ' proposal .
I honestly think the pendulum is beginning to swing back from the far left .
We can always hope .
Once the traditional marriage is safe , then I am confident the people will get busy to provide a way for gay couples to enjoy the same protections as married people do , and I think that will pass with scarcely more than a murmor .
A new report on global warming , the product of a task force of academics , business leaders and politicians , chaired by former Blair administration Transport Minister Stephen Byers and Republican Senator Olympia Snowe , is deeply unsettling .
I love when those that do n't get it claim there ca n't be global warming cause it 's 8 degrees and theres 3 feet of snow on the ground .
That 's actually one of the things ( record / increased snowfall ) that indicates global warning IS taking place .
What I do n't get is why some so vehemently deny global warming .
What is the benefit of denying that it is happening or accepting that it is possible ?
Ya learn something new every day ....
Ambergris is used in perfumes or as a perfume .
I thought it was a type of amber ( a tree resin product ) , but it is totally unrelated .
Ambergris is basically , sperm whale trace .
You know how hawks and coyotes vomit up the undigestible parts of their food ?
So do sperm whales .
The stuff the eject is fould and gross , but after it floats in the sun , on the ocean , for many years , it becomes ambergris - worth a small fortune too .....
There was nothing the 19th century whalers prized more highly -- a good haul of ambergris could allow all the ships officers to retire , or buy their own ships -- and allow the sailors to get famously drunk , until they were robbed and went lookin ' for a new berth ...
I found that quite interesting .
Imagine breaking open a chunk of a ambergris and discovering something like that ...
" Hey , Kris , what the hell is this thing inside the ambergris ? "
" Let me have a look .
I believe that is the hard beak of a giant squid ! "
That initial article said it was banned in the US under some endangered species thingie -- why , though ?
It seems like it 's pretty separated from any harm to the animal .
( If they kill one for it , if they get anything at all they 'll some foul - smelling bile that has to be floated on the sea for 10 years or more ... )
The ambergris itself is considered an endangered species , soz .
It is considered to be a floating ecosystem , sort of a microcosm of a rain forest , and every time one is destroyed scientists lose valuable information that might have been used for discovering a cure for cancer or some other dealdly malady .
Obama dramatically escalated the extrajudicial killings by America around the world ( mainly in Yemen , Pakistan and Afghanistan ) since taking office .
For example , in his first year in office America carried out more drone attacks in Pakistan than Bush 's entire presidency .
The next year ?
He more than doubled his own increased rate .
Obama is sending out these drones to kill people at a rate of once every 4 days .
Bush 's average was about once every 50 .
We 've made a new generation of enemies in Pakistan and Afghanistan for these assassinations ( and the " night raids " Obama escalated in Afghanistan ) .
Other than Bin Laden , nobody we are killing had anything to do with 9/11 .
A decade later many of the young men we are assassinating ( along with the civillians that constitute one third of the number killed by these drones ) must have been kids when that happened .
Do you think this is a good idea ?
If this was Bush would you be protesting it ?
Voting against him ?
Why can Obama , the greatest drone murderer in history , get away with it with hardly a word about it ?
He even gets away with cracking jokes about predator drones while I know damn well that most of you here would have excoriated Bush for something like that .
So why is it ?
Do you all just not know that Obama has escalated the killings done in your name or do you just not care anymore ?
Is war cool now ?
Are these killing moral now ?
Why are the lives Bush was killing more valuable than the ones that Obama is killing ?
Why are you guys gonna vote for this warmonger ?
When you go on a crusade you do n't pull any punches with your headlines , do you , Robert ?
That 's a bit over the top , don'cha think ?
I stated long ago that I no longer support him .
I will vote third party , if at all , since neither major party wants to nominate somebody with my values .
I see your point , which you made well on the other thread .
I had a discussion a week or so ago with a old lib friend thinking about voting for Ron Paul , and I went on about my old theory about watching for the company someone keeps .
That 's from my hematology days , when if you find a blast cell in a peripheral smear , it was very likely a progenitor of the cells around it , thus helping identify the leukemia .
( Long ago , do n't know what they do on that now . )
Thus , I might like a Republican , but would worry about the administration that came along with him or her .
I ended with saying I 'm not all so happy about the " company Obama keeps " either .
I convinced her , but my conviction on this is shallow .
She and I are both in despair about Obama for reasons already well discussed on a2k re his get along mode .
I 'm not sure she is as troubled by U.S. actions around the world as I am , but I think so .
I 'm interested in third party mavericks , but have trouble envisioning how that would work out even if I approved of the candidate .
Could Gary Johnson work out ?
Huntsman as an independent ?
Or , get elected in the first place ?
Given a Republican in office , one of those in the present batch of candidates , I have more trouble not seeing things get worse in some ugly ways re the economy and how life would work for the struggling with little income .
I 've despaired with presidents before , though .
So , lets say a Republican is elected - I can imagine increasing polarization in the citizenry as an outcome .
It might result in real change - but in just what ways ?
You sound like you 'd rather see that than put up with Dem mediocrity any further .
On that , I both see your point and am not there yet myself .
Why , I 'll say I fear things being worse ( to me ) for a while might spiral out of control .
Here 's a funny one : when I got a job working for the local college I had to show my birth certificate before they would hire me .
Mine had been mislaid and I 'd asked if there was any way I could work in lieu of finding it , but they said : no they would not hire me without a birth certificate .
But Barack Obama has yet to produce a valid birth certificate and is no president of the United States .
Not only does it take less paperwork to become president of the United States than a tutor at a local college , but the US constitution requires the President must be a natural born citizen !
Without requiring proof of birth we have waived this constitutional requirement .
@Muarck , Note : this is not conservative or republican agenda .
I 'm a democrat who voted Hillary Clinton .
This is just about gross violations of the U.S. constitution .
Who are you trying to fool ?
Obama produced a valid birth certificate .
It was verified by the State of Hawaii .
It 's been upheld in numerous court proceedings .
It 's been investigated by just about every news organization out there .
But you do n't have an agenda , yeah right .
A certified copy of a birth certificate issued by the state of birth is valid legal proof of birth , acceptable in a court of law .
NO ONE gets their ORIGINAL certificate of birth .
Those always stay on file in wherever the state keeps their vital records .
Obama has shown a certified copy .
It 's been examined several times and declared valid .
The State of Hawaii has verified the original .
Give it up . He 's legal
according to the AP .... here 's a local link
I 've been wondering when that 'd be called !
CNN has both Missouri and NC at " 100 % reporting " but they 're still not colored in .
I am shocked that this happened .
I am not unhappy but I am shocked .
The tension and animosity on the street in NC is palpable .
I 've been threatened physically twice .... like I give a shit ....
I do tend to stir the pot I realize .
Last night at my gig some drunks late night were discussing what to call Obama ... bandying the usual right wing talk around and I said " I suggest you call him the motherfucking President Elect " .
He was n't sure what to say in response to that so he paid his tab and left
After last night 's events in Brussels , it 's clear that the UK does n't want to be a part of the Europe ( or just the EU ? ) anymore .
The continent can cope without the British .
But can the UK go to a prosperous future without the Euro , without the continent ?
What alliances are now possible ? Just the USA , or the a re - organised Commonwealth ?
Where will be the future place of this country among Europe , Russia , China , the USA ?
The UK has said " Bye , bye Europe " .
I hope they know the meaning of " Auf wiedersehen " !
@Walter Hinteler , I ca n't remember where I read the analysis , but the conclusion which made sense to me was that currency boundaries ultimately implied federal boundaries .
To be anthropomorphic , the " UK psyche " resists federal union with Europe as evidenced by their original reluctance to join the Eurozone .
This latest decision is symptomatic of that resistance but economic events will ultimately decide whether " resistance is futile " .
It 's also a sovereignty issue -- and sovereignty is something which the EU has never effectively addressed .
Ever crucial issue is put up for a plebecite , or a vote by nation -- and the population of one or more countries , or the governments of one of more countries , torpedo the deal .
As a " union , " it 's farcical .
Not too long ago , when Barack Obama campaigned for the presidency , he was all about human rights .
And man did he chastise the Republicans ' approach to them .
Time and time again , Obama emphasized ( and I 'm quoting from memory here ) that under his rule America would n't lead the world through the example of its power , but through the power of its example .
One of his first acts as president was to announce the shutdown of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , which had come to symbolize the Bush administration 's fast , loose , and secretive approach to human rights .
Last week , the Obama administration had a perfect opportunity to act on its rhetoric , to set an example of America 's new spirit , to specifically deliver " change we can believe in " .
To understand this opportunity , you have to remember that Guantanamo Bay was just the tip of the iceberg .
The rest of the iceberg , hidden underneath the waterline from public scrutiny and media symbolism , exists a system of CIA prisons in foreign countries .
When the CIA suspects people of connections to terrorism , it snatches them off the streets wherever they live , flies them to those secret prisons , and interrogates them .
Credible reports allege that the CIA uses torture to extract information from them .
( I 've written about one of the victims a little over three years ago ) .
When some of the victims are trying to pursue their cases in federal court , the Bush administration tried to throw out their cases on a theory about government secrets .
Obama , consistent with the rest of his human rights rhetoric , sharply criticized Bush for it .
But now that Bush 's secrecy theory is before an appeals court , Obama is changing his mind .
Without qualifications , he is now sticking to the Bush position that torture victims cannot sue the CIA , because the torture is a state secret .
" Change we can believe in " ?
Yeah right .
That is so a year ago !
It 's what most politicians would do ... but still ... sigh .
The hell of it is to whom do we turn .
The Bush and Regan policies that have put us in this position ?
We all voted for Obama because of these policies but where do we turn to really gain a government of the people for ALL the people .
Democrat , republican , all I see are crooked politicians who are only interested in thier own gain and screw the rest of us .
Well it was n't just campaign promises , he repeated it in his inauguration , when he already had the presidency in hand .
" We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals . "
Apparently he was missing some qualifiers , so I 'll fix it for him :
" We sometimes reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals when it is politically convenient . "
Yeah , I just saw this for the first time too .
Does n't look good , but I do n't know anything beyond what 's here .
Thomas -- when 's the last time you saw me say ANYTHING about Obama , yay or boo ?
I 'm still in politics detox mode and still just not following this stuff .
Also just plain not on A 2K much .
This happened to be recently replied to when I checked in just now .
I wonder which couple of years he is referring to .
The power of propaganda .
Even half - ways intelligent people just automatically repeat this propaganda that 's been driven into their heads .
Interesting use of subject / object pronouns .
I have been busy the last few days .
Today is the first I heard about the story on NPR .
I admit I do n't know the facts but on it 's face I disagree with the decision .
It 's 4 days old ?
It certainly had n't made it into my paper unless I skimmed over it .
Gushing like teenagers about their first crush ? I do n't gush Thomas .
This is n't really an endorsement of torture and rendition , is it ?
With nothing to go on except the link to the NYT article , it looks more like there is n't going to be legal action against CIA and the unnamed Boeing subsidiary for activities they were assured were legal at the time .
I never felt obliged to report every screwup made by the previous administration .
There were so many better qualified people to handle that .
Rockström said that when rich countries increase their consumption , they also accelerate the exploitation of the world 's national resources , with the result that they emit more greenhouse gases .
This will ultimately accelerate the speed of desertification in sub - Saharan African countries and other areas of the world .
The ice sheet has melted earlier this season .
Consequently , experts have predicted that the world has at least ten years within which to lower the volume of greenhouse gas emissions before it is too late to redeem the situation .
A jeweler 's shop in Tokyo displayed a swimsuit , dress and shawl to go with it made of pure gold thread today . These were made by a workshop in the ancient capital , Kyoto .
Tokyo 's Ginza Tanaka Jewelry Company said that the hand - woven gold dress weighs 1.1 kilograms , with a value of 30 million Japanese yen ( about 8.06 million NT dollars ) .
The low - cut gold swimsuit with a low back weighs 500 grams , with a sales price of 10 million Japanese yen .
A spokesperson for the company said , " The dress and swimsuit can be worn just like ordinary clothing , but must be treated the same as jewelry , and cannot be washed in a washing machine . "
The company is also displaying a relatively inconspicuous gold wall tapestry , which can be used to decorate the living room , at a price of 50 million Japanese yen ( about 13.42 million NT dollars ) .
The London emergency services said that altogether 11 people had been sent to hospital for treatment due to minor wounds .
After the seven hundred passengers on the train were stranded for two hours , they were guided through the tunnels to a safe place .

According to a report on Taiwan 's ETTV News website , the old man , who is 85 years old this year , was originally called Fu Hei - han , but as an officer thought this name to be uncultured when he enlisted in the army as a young man , he changed the name for him to Fu Hsing - han with the intended meaning of " making the Chinese world prosperous . " Although the name 's homophone always got him laughed at , he did n't mind at all .
Li Jinhua hopes to see " the audit body audited " before he leaves office .
He said that establishing clean government was the very lifeline of audit work .
The audit body needs to further strengthen its internal management , keep the audit team under strict control , take the initiative in accepting outside supervision , and voluntarily publicize details of its internal financial audit .
Audit cadres must require themselves to adhere to the standards they apply when auditing others .
To forge iron , you must first temper yourself . " If you are dishonest yourself , how can you make others honest ? "
The question is now , can we broaden out a bit the Audit Office director 's train of thought ?
Do prosecuting authorities dare to be " prosecuted ? "
Do industrial and commercial departments dare to be " supervised ? "
It seems that some people are getting more and more narrow - minded : they only know how to make demands ; they do n't know how to repay people for their kindness .
After the old couple 's invitation to him to spend the Spring Festival with them was rejected , they actually took the initiative to lend their own vehicle to the young person .
At times like this , we need refined manners , that is , let your heart always knows gratitude !
An old man who was close to death called his sons and daughters before him , and told them a story of how he was helped by someone , instructing his descendants to repay that person .
This is the most beautiful gift an old man can leave the world .
He made people realize the strength of gratitude and touching nature of reciprocation .
Two years ago , a friend whom I had n't seen for many years found me , and said he wanted to do some business .
I asked him how much capital he had .
When I heard that , I immediately burst out laughing . What can you do with 10,000 yuan ?
Sure enough it was n't long before my friend opened a one - yuan shoeshine shop on a busy street corner .
Otherwise , even given more opportunities , you can still lose them .

I 'll be returning to my country in September . Now there are two places I can go to . Can everyone help me see which is more suitable for me ?
1 . Chinese Academy of Sciences . To be trained according to the Hundred Talents Program and paid according to the Hundred Talents Program benefits , but there is no guarantee I will definitely get it .
Although there are still papers to be published after I return to my country , they 're quite useless for the application to the Hundred Talents Program .
2 . A second tier provincial university , professor , 150,000 - 200,000 yuan housing subsidy and 50,000 yuan research grant .
I can work on my current research topic .
I can only be an advisor for the Master 's program . They do n't have doctoral programs as of today .
My husband suggested that I go to 1 because the starting point is higher , the current pay is alright , and if I ca n't make it there in future I can still go to 2 .
The university is in the suburb ; the school district is fairly ordinary , and there are not many choices in terms of housing .

He just emailed that friend to ask him how much it cost .
However , my friend has to work and very probably cannot come back immediately . I 'm afraid I ca n't drag for these few days .
Yi Jianlian was selected by Milwaukee Bucks as sixth pick but he was n't willing to play there , leading to much heated discussion recently .
Why must he go to a city with many Chinese people ?
Actually , so what if he goes to Milwaukee ? There is no superstar there , but this is exactly his chance .
Moreover , he is not qualified to bargain with his owner when he has yet to prove his power on the NBA court .
On second thought , he can absolutely play in another city when his rookie player contract ends after three to four years .
Yao 's team is obviously a notch better in terms of attitude and way of dealing with things . I really do not wish for Yi 's team to become the second Wang Zhizhi .

In early 1919 , Gu Weijun , the Chinese envoy to the United States , went to France to participate in the Paris Peace Conference as the plenipotentiary of his own country 's government .
Xiao Kejian , Gu Weijun 's good friend , was arrested by French police for organizing a strike in Paris to fight for equal pay for equal work for Chinese workers in France .
However , his extreme action of joining Korean revolutionists in bombing the hotel the Japanese delegation lived in made Korea and China the center of public opinion .
The Paris Peace Conference rejected China 's just request in the end and decided to let Japan take over Germany 's special rights over Jiaodong Peninsula .
This caused the momentous " May 4 th " Movement to break out in the country , and Xiao Kejian and others also protested in Paris .

And Fawzi al-Benzarti actually traveled to Tripoli along with his son , Ayman , and his brother , Sami .
The Israeli newspapers that were published yesterday devoted supplements to the one year anniversary of the July war , which covered the different aspects of this war and its repercussions on Israel .
According to Alof Ben in Haaretz , the biggest loser in this war is Ehud Olmert and the Kadima party , and the theory of unilateral Israeli withdrawals .
On the other hand , the war has strengthened the position of the right and its leader , Benjamin Netanyahu , and it helped to bring Ehud Barak back to the government .
But the most critical review is the one by Ben Kasbit in Maariv . He wrote : " Did we win the war that broke out exactly a year ago , or were we defeated ?
Not exactly .
But since Israel must win the confrontation with its enemy , the draw equals a defeat .
Is our position today better than what it was a year ago on the eve of the war ?
Is the position of Hezbollah better today than it was a year ago ?
No , the party has been dealt quite a major military blow , but from another point of view , it achieved an important moral victory .
It is true that it was pushed back off the border fence , but it is entrenching and fortifying itself to the north of the Litani .
It withstood its confrontation with the Israeli military might , but it lost many of its troops and lost the element of surprise .
Nasrallah is in a real hole and Olmert is in a virtual one , since his approval rate is almost equal to zero and the danger of the Vinograd report is lurking on the horizon .
This is the first time that the big powerful Arab states stood openly with Israel in its war on an Islamic - Arab enemy .
The global struggle of civilizations is happening here on our land before the eyes of the world .
It was not for nothing that Europe sent the multinational force to south Lebanon , and the Americans are deploying all that they have left to support the Siniora government in Beirut .
Everyone knows that Iranian control over Lebanon and the imminent American departure from Iraq will contribute to the downfall of moderate Islam in the Middle East and the supremacy of the fundamentalists .
Is the army rebuilding its force ?
The new chief of staff is the right person in the right place .
Therefore , I call upon the citizens in general , and those of al-Matn in particular , to show their support for the Lebanese Army through civilized and democratic behavior as is their habit in this area .
At the top of the list of this wave of profits came Orascom Construction , which led the stock market upward before and is now leading it downward .
Shares of the Suwaidi Cable Company , which is one of the best performing companies in the recent period , also fell by 3.8 % to close at a price of 77.50 pounds per share .
Shukri said that the share price of al-Suwaidi Cables has almost doubled over the past two months . Therefore , it is natural that we see such a readiness to sell .
It is obvious that it is a correction process for the market , and it is natural after the waves of high performance .
But the drop did not prevail over the entire market .
The Egyptian Financial Group - Hermes also achieved slight gains . Its share price rose by 0.5 % to 48.49 pounds .

The statement , which was published on an electronic website that is used by Islamists , said that al-Qaeda Mujahideen in the Islamic Maghreb Countries raided three apostate centers in the city of Yakouren in Tizi Ouzou .
It was not possible to confirm the credibility of this statement from an independent source .
The statement added , " The overall result of the raid was the annihilation of no less than 25 apostates , between the dead and injured . "
The source added that the remainder of the armed Islamic group members managed to flee . Two people were wounded within the army ranks .
Al - Qaeda said that the Mujahideen returned safely without any significant injuries in their ranks .

Fields of work for Saudi woman ( missing specializations and useless qualifications )
These successes open the door wide to questions about the absence of these specializations from the universities , colleges and institutes of the Kingdom .
Did that lead to women 's absence or exclusion from practicing these professions as a consequence of the non - existence of these specializations , which is also why they are not in the labor market ?

Since the start of this campaign in April / " April " , warnings have been issued to thousands of women , among whom hundreds have been arrested for not abiding by the religious dress code .
Women , whether Iranian or foreign , have been required to wear the veil since the Islamic Revolution in the year 1979 , but recent years saw some relaxation , particularly with respect to wearing the veil .
The Ministry requested that the officers of this Committee hand over the persons whom they arrest to regular police forces , which are to carry out their own interrogations of them .
This religious police force is also under investigation following a campaign of raids during which an Asian woman fell to her death from the fifth floor last May in the region of Holy Mecca .
Al - Watan stated that this religious police force was the object of more than 20 complaints in the year 2006 .
It came to a head . On the afternoon of June / June 12 the Al - Qassam Brigades had had it with this collaborator group 's continuation of its Zionist and American plans to eliminate the Islamic Movement .
The Guardian : Kurds and Al - Maliki Agree on Iraqi Oil Revenue - Sharing
Iraq sells about 1.3 million barrels of oil per day , the revenues of which constitute 93 % of the budget of the central government in Baghdad .

Old Man Robs a Bank .. Only to Return to Jail
A 74 - year - old homeless thief fulfilled his only wish , which was to return to jail for the next five years .
During the trial , the Public Prosecutor said that the old , alcoholic thief had become homeless and committed the theft in order to return to prison .
The Court also found that Newnham had been convicted on charges of shoplifting from stores almost every year over a period of 36 years .
Newnham said that robbing the bank was much easier than sorting out his affairs and his retirement spending outside the prison .
The issue therefore does not concern some opinions that provoke waves of objection , but rather it fundamentally concerns a vision of the role of the Church , its ideology , and its universal message .
So the beginning denied the relationship between Islam and reason , as though Islam is a religion that is hostile to reason and there is no place for reason in the Islamic faith .
The search for a war in which victory would be easy is in reality no more than an electoral campaign . This campaign can only succeed in electing or re - electing the neo - conservatives as leaders of the United States . But it is a success whose price is to push the world toward destruction , fabricated crises that detract from the real challenges , and the absence of a compass and priorities .

A United Nation nuclear team will make a week - long visit to North Korea this weekend to inspect the Stalinist state 's controversial nuclear site .
Government sources said on January 7 , 2002 that a united nation nuclear team will make a week - long visit to North Korea this weekend to inspect the Stalinist state 's controversial nuclear site .
The upcoming visit is viewed as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) drive to clarify North Korea 's nuclear ambitions .
A government source stated the visit by a group of IAEA safety experts is scheduled to last for a week beginning January 12 , 2002 .
The source stated that the inspection would focus on an isotope production laboratory in the Yongbyon nuclear complex which is north of North Korea 's capital Pyongyang .
The IAEA tour of the isotope production laboratory will unlikely give a full picture of North Korea 's suspected nuclear weapons ambitions .
The tour was a surprise offer made by North Korea in November 2001 .
IAEA accepted North Korea 's proposal last month but cautioned that the proposal is not a breakthrough .
IAEA also stated the lab is not one of the frozen facilities it wants to look into .
IAEA is based in Vienna and is the UN 's nuclear supervisor .
North Korea has denied the IAEA full access to its facilities .
North Korea froze its suspected nuclear weapons program at Yongbyon in exchange for receiving two nuclear reactors producing less weapons - grade plutonium under a 1994 accord with the United States .
The 4.6 - billion - dollar project was due to be completed by 2003 .
Delays have pushed back the finish until at least 2008 .
Pyongyang insists it will allow full IAEA inspections only when a significant portion of the project as defined in the 1994 accord is completed .

South Koreans rallied on January 11 , 2002 in support of their right to eat dog meat .
They threatened an Internet war as part of a campaign to defend the traditional cuisine .
A nationalist group has vowed cyber hostilities against U.S. based media company Warner Bros . and one of France 's state - run television channels .
The activists accuse the organizations of being culturally - biased and insulting .
A South Korean group has announced a campaign backed by food scientists to promote the eating of dog meat .
This announcement was in response to increasing foreign criticism of the way dogs are slaughtered in South Korea .
The killing of dogs for restaurants has become a more popular topic than the football World Cup finals .
The World Cup finals are to be co - hosted by South Korea and Japan this year .
The debate was partly fueled by FIFA , football 's international governing body .
FIFA urged South Korea to prevent the inhumane killing of dogs .
South Koreans are angered by the international pressure on their traditional cuisine .
The organizers of South Korean website antijapan . wo . ro vowed to paralyze the websites of Warner Bros . ( www.wpix.com ) and the French state television network ( www.francetv.fr ) on January 19 , 2002 .
The organizers of the South Korean website accused the broadcasters of falsely describing South Koreans and their food culture as barbaric .
The anti - Japan group stated that South Korean culture is under attack .
The statement was made to gain supporters to join the lobbying .
Cyber warfare has become a common weapon for South Koreans .
They are one of the most Internet savvy nations in the world .
South Korean cyber campaigners disabled Japanese education ministry websites last year in a protest against history books accused of skimming Japan 's wartime record in Asia .
The nationalist group was formed to campaign against Japan .
The group said the foreign broadcasters are battering the eating dogmeat culture and that it is insulting behavior .
It tramples on a tradition of one country .
The group said the foreign broadcasters do not show any remorse for their culture of eating snails and horses .
The cyber attack is to show the power of South Koreans and Asians against the West 's sense of superiority and ignorance of South Korea 's history .
Another group said they will launch an association next Monday of around 100 dog meat restaurant owners in the Seoul region and hold a seminar to promote the dish .
Food scientist at Chung Chong College an Yong - geun said he would introduce some 350 different kinds of culinary art with dog meat .
French actress - turned activist Brigitte Bardot and other animal rights campaigners call to stop the South Korean practice of eating dogs .
FIFA president Sepp Blatter sent a letter last November to South Korea 's World Cup organizing committee calling for immediate and decisive measures against cruelty to dogs .
It was ahead of the World Cup which starts May 31 , 2002 .
Head of the Korean Football Association and a FIFA vice president Chung Mong - Joon said FIFA should not intervene in the eating habits of a sovereign nation .
South Korean officials said most dogs used for eating were killed instantly by electrocution .
Activists contend many slaughterhouses in the countryside are not controlled .
They strangle dogs , hang them by a rope and beat them in line with traditional practice to make the meat more tender .
Dog restaurants were told to close or go into the backstreets when Seoul hosted the 1988 Olympics .
No similar move is planned for the World Cup .
The authorities say the practice is slowly disappearing in Korea .
A recent survey stated that about one million dogs are sold every year for food in South Korea and 92 percent of men aged 20 and above and 68 percent of adult women have tasted dog meat .

Religious extremism continues in Pakistan despite the banning of militant groups by the Pakistani Government .
Newspapers and magazines extolling the virtues of Islamic holy war in Kashmir continue to fill the newstands in Pakistan despite the Pakistani military Government 's attempt at a large scale containment of religious extremism .
Around 1400 alleged religious extremists have been arrested since 020112 under severe actions against Islamic militants and sectarian radicals announced by President Pervez Musharraf during the weekend .
The severe actions against militants and radicals came as Pervez Musharraf banned 5 Islamic groups .
The banned 5 Islamic groups included the 2 hardline militant groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir which the Indian government accuses of staging the violent 011213 attack on the Indian parliament .
Pakistani authorities have stated that no statements or literature from the 5 banned Islamic groups would be tolerated after Pervez Musharraf 's speech banning the 5 Islamic groups .
Pervez Musharraf 's speech banning the 5 Islamic groups was applauded by the United States .
Iftikhar Ahmed stated that under the notification that was issued late at night on 020114 all publications , newspapers , weekly magazines , monthlies , etc of the 5 banned Islamic groups are banned and confiscated .
Iftikhar Ahmed is a Pakistani interior ministry official .
Iftikhar Ahmed stated that Pakistan 's provincial governments have been asked to implement the orders in the notification that was issued on 020114 and that Pakistan 's provincial governments are in the process of taking action .
Karachi police chief Tariq Jamil stated that the 5 banned Islamic groups would not be allowed to operate in any way .
Tariq Jamil stated that he would examine if the baned literature is still available in the market despite the ban .
The 2 hardline militant groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir are the Lashkar - e - Taiba and Jaish - e - Mohammad .
The Lashkar - e - Taiba and Jaish - e - Mohammad are still distributing their message through a range of publications and magazines easily available in Karachi .
Other groups linked to terrorism and included on the United States Terrorist Exclusion List are also publishing regular newspapers and journals containing rhetoric that is against Western countries and calls for war in the name of Islam .
Qari Mohammad Zafar stated that his elders urged him to read about Jihad through the Islam daily published by the Al-Rashid Trust and Lashkar - i - Taiba 's zarb - e - Taiba weekly .
Qari Mohammad Zafar is an 18 - year - old student of a religious seminary .
Qari Mohammad Zafar stated that he did not know whether the Pakistani government will also ban the publications encouraging Jihad .
Qari Mohammad Zafar stated that himself and other people have been told by our elders to read pro - Jihad newspapers and magazines .
The al-Rashid Trust and Lashkar - i - Taiba are on the United States Terrorist Exclusion List and the Al-Rashid Trust 's and Lashkar - i - Taiba 's assets frozen in Pakistan .
The Al-Rashid Trust has not been officially banned in Pakistan .
The primary editorial in The Islam daily of Al-Rashid Trust on 020115 carried a warning to the Pakistani government .
The Islam daily of Al-Rashid Trust supports the Taliban Fund linked to Osama bin Laden 's al-Qaeda network .
The headline in the Islam daily of Al-Rashid Trust on 020115 stated action extreme against extremism above an article stating that the Pakistani government should not domineer a large section of Pakistani society which supported the jihad against Indian rule in the divided Himalayan state of Kashmir .
Newspaper seller Mohammad Farooq stated that Pervez Musharraf 's clamp - down on extremism had done little to limit the demand for banned religious extremist publications .
Mohammad Farooq stated that the publication of the Islam daily of Al-Rashid Trust has not been affected yet by Pervez Musharraf 's clamp - down on extremism and the circulation of the Islam daily of Al-Rashid Trust has increased in the past couple of days .
Over 12 publications including dailies , weeklies and monthlies of various extremist groups including those banned on 020112 still sell in large numbers in the markets and bazaars of Karachi .
Police officer Mohammad Iqbal stated that the police so far have not received any instructions to take action against any banned religious extremist publications .
Analysts stated that the Pakistani government may have trouble explaining the Pakistani government 's reasoning if the banned religious extremist groups ' publications are suddenly removed from the newsstands because the Pakistani Government generally supports the freedom of the press .
A reporter who did not want to be named from the publication of the Islam daily of Al-Rashid Trust stated that it would not be easy for the Pakistani government to ban the religious extremist publications and make over 500 employees jobless .

Canadian government 's warning of al-Qaeda 's capability to launch a cyberattack causes various industries to review their preparedness .
Critical infrastructures including energy and transportation providers cite close work with Government to remain aware of threats and to update accordingly .
A recent government warning that al-Qaeda terrorists could launch a cyberattack on Canadian interests or critical infrastructure has caused many concerned industries to review their security systems .
Vice President of Canadian electricity Association Francis Bradley stated that the company has a warning system for both physical and cyberattacks .
Bradley stated that the company has been significantly focused on prevention of cyberattacks .
In a recent interview Bradley stated that many utility firms perform a brief review of their multi - tiered response systems after such warnings are issued .
The warning from the Canadian Department of National Defense 's office of critical infrastructure protection and emergency service was quietly released on 20 December 2001 and cited no specific threat .
Director of threat analysis at the Canadian Department of National Defense 's office of critical infrastructure protection and emergency service Brenda hensler - Hobbs stated that following the attacks of 11 September 2001 the Canadian Government specifically examined the potential cyber - capability of al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden 's followers .
Hensler - Hobbs stated that the Canadian government has no knowledge of Al-Qaeda having engaged in cyberattacks in the past but that leader bin Laden has suggested that if he chose to launch cyberattacks he could have the means available to him .
In summary of the recent warning stating that such an attack could be executed in the very near future hensler - Hobbs stated that bin Laden 's location was irrelevant because bin Laden possesses the money and supporters necessary to have such an attack executed by others .
A number of al-Qaeda militants including Millennium plot bomber Ahmed Ressam are known to have remained in Canada .
Many are located in Montreal .
Hensler - Hobbs stated that the proliferation and availability of Hacker tools and the low skill level needed to conduct cyberattacks demonstrate the ease of launching an attack anywhere .
Hensler - Hobbs cited the example of the Montreal - based Hacker known as mafiaboy who attacked U.S. websites including Amazon.com in 2000 .
Many think that security must be improved at North American critical infrastructures including energy and transportation providers and the financial services sector that are largely interconnected .
Many businesses began preparing for cyber incidents before the year 2000 .
A separate report issued recently by the U.S. government - funded research group computer science and telecommunications Board stated that cyber security needs considerable improvement .
For example , according to a Canadian government estimate the love bug launched in May 2000 caused 6.7 billion U.S. dollars in damage and disrupted Canadian government systems .
Bell Canada spokesman Andrew Cole stated that Bell Canada is prepared and remains prepared for various potential situations and scenarios .
Cole stated --
Bell Canada works very closely with the Government and the private sector to be aware of security concerns and to update accordingly .
Bell Canada worked closely with U.S. officials and firms after the attacks of 11 September 2001 .
Bell Canada provides a total of 26 million phone and Internet connections to a nation of 30 million people .
Bradley stated --
Electricity firms have strong warning systems that are coordinated by the North American Electric reliability Council .
There has not been a cyber event that has resulted in a loss of power for utility customers .
There is little possibility that a cyberattack would disable a North American electric grid .
Electric companies are well prepared and are making all preparations required to be ready for any physical or cyberattack .
The North American Electric reliability Council 's 30 largest utility companies went on their highest alert on September 11 and many still have an increased security presence in effect and plan to extend it further .

Russia 's military authorities criticized Kamchatenergo Power Company for imposing a shutdown on supplies to a command center that guides military satellites in orbit and contributes to systems controlling the international space station .
The Kamchatenergo company disconnected a major control center of the Russian space forces located in Kamchatka early Saturday , the Russian Space Forces press service said .
Kamchatenergo feeds power to the vast Kamchatka peninsula in Russia 's far east .
A statement from the Russian Space Forces press services on 020126 called the action a direct violation of government decrees on defense facilities and stated that it could have led to the loss of a spacecraft costing hundreds of millions of rubles .
The monitoring center is a key element in maintaining Russia 's satellite network in orbit and plays a part in operations of the international space platform Alfa .
Officials at the command center took urgent measures to use reserve power units to keep the system functioning and to temporarily provide residential centers with electricity .
Several other military bases and strategic defense units were affected .
The State power monopoly United energy services and its regional subsidiary Kamchatenergo launched a program of power cuts to long - term debtors on 020125 .
United energy services argues that non - payment of bills has prevented it from maintaining supplies .
The Russian Space Forces , the space branch of Russia 's armed forces , expressed alarm at the prospect of further power cuts resulting from delays in Federal budget resources reaching local authorities on time .

The Kamchatka Command Center maintains Russia 's satellite network in orbit .
The Kamchatka command center plays a role in ISS operations .
cutting power to command centers could pose dangers for Russian space installations .
Power cuts could lead to a failure of all work with space craft .
The ISS could function for an orbit or two without ground control by using standby systems .
A total unexpected loss of power during control of military equipment could be catastrophic .
The Government or UES or the Ministry of Defense must resolve the issue .
The Kamchatenergo company feeds power to Kamchatka Peninsula .

An Australian jury found that an Uzbekistan Olympic boxing official was defamed in a book about alleged Olympic corruption in which he was depicted as a major international heroin dealer and racketeer .
A New South Wales Supreme Court jury took just over 2 hours on 020201 to find Gafur Rakhimov had been libelled in a book the Great Olympic swindle which alleges Olympic corruption .
Gafur Rakhimov is an Uzbekistan Olympic boxing official and was depicted in the book as a major international heroin dealer and racketeer .
The Great Olympic swindle was written by British journalist Andrew Jennings and published by Simon and Schuster .
The Rakhimov case will now go to a single judge to hear defences and decide any damages to be awarded to Rakhimov .
The Great Olympic swindle implied that Gafur Rakhimov had been engaged in fraud , prostitution , assassination , gun running and plutonium smuggling .
The book also implied that the businessman was a gangster in the Soviet black economy and had traded sporting medals for bribes .
Rakhimov was Vice - President of the Olympic Council of Asia and an Executive Member of the International Amateur Boxing Association .
Rakhimov was also said to have bribed members of the International Amateur Boxing Federation in the vote for the Federation Presidency .
Jennings is a long - time critic of the International Olympic Committee .
The 020201 verdict followed 2 defamation actions brought last year by Rakhimov against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) and Jennings and against the Sydney Morning Herald ( SMH ) and Jennings .
A jury found in the case involving the ABC that ABC 's flagship current affairs program four corners had implied Rakhimov knew some of the world 's most dangerous criminals and was suspected by the FBI of drug trafficking .
That Panel found those insinuations were not defamatory and threw out the case against the ABC and Jennings .
The SMH and Jennings were then sued over 3 articles published in the lead - up to the 000000 Olympics .
The jury in that case found Rakhimov had been painted as a major international criminal and had been defamed .

OSCE urges permanent end to Afghan terrorism and drug - trafficking to create long - term stability in Central Asia .
Expert states that cultivation of opium and drug trafficking are deeply entrenched in Afghanistan and will be impossible to eradicate .
On 10 February 2002 an official with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe was quoted as stating that long - term stability in Central Asia depends on eradicating post - Taliban Afghan terrorism and drug - trafficking .
The OSCE envoy in neighboring Tajikistan Marc Gilbert stated to the government weekly national gazette that there are now hopes that Afghanistan will develop its democratic institutions and end terrorism and drug - smuggling resulting in greater stability in Central Asia .
Gilbert stated that the post - Soviet republics in central Asia fought terrorism by giving material and other necessary help to the international anti - terrorist coalition in the war against Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden and the Taliban regime .
Both Tajikistan and Uzbekistan share a border with Afghanistan and have experienced raids by Taliban - backed Islamic militants in recent years .
Neighboring Kyrgyzstan has also experienced raids by Taliban - backed Islamic militants in recent years .
Kazakhstan also became a key U.S. partner in the Afghan war opening its airspace to military overflights .
Turkmenistan maintained a more neutral stance .
Turkmenistan borders Afghanistan .
Gilbert stated that Tajikistan 's positive and responsible approach to the crisis in Afghanistan has significantly improved the country 's image internationally .
Tajik government expert and head of the Tajik Drug Control Agency Vladimir Rakhmonov stated on 10 February 2002 that the U.S. - led war in Afghanistan had failed to stop drug trafficking across the border into Tajikistan .
Rakhmonov stated to Interfax --
Opium and heroin are a form of hard - currency reserve for Afghanistan .
Drug trafficking from Afghanistan has been concealed so securely that it will be impossible to uncover .
Drug trafficking from Afghanistan resumed during a brief hiatus in the anti - terrorist operation .
In 2001 Tajik law - enforcement agencies and Russian border guards seized 8.8 tons of drugs including 4.2 tons of heroin .
This represented a 26 percent increase overall in 2001 with 3 times the amount of heroin .
Suggestions that there are no longer drug lords in Afghanistan and that drug traffic into Tajikistan has been eradicated are unrealistic and false .
Many years would be needed to convert Afghanistan 's agriculture historically specialized in the growing of raw opium .
Cultivation of raw opium provided the only source of income for much of the rural population .
Tajikistan 's 780 - mile border with Afghanistan is patrolled by approximately 11000 Russian soldiers under a 1992 agreement between the Russian and Tajik Governments .

Afghan officials conducted talks with Russian officials asking for assistance in stopping Afghanistan 's large illegal opium and heroin trade .
Afghanistan seeks to end poppy harvesting and increase border control .
March 1 , 2002 interim interior minister of Afghanistan Yunus Qanooni asked Russian officials to assist in combating the drugs trade and establishing security in Afghanistan .
Qanooni is a member of the Northern Alliance .
Qanooni told Russian Deputy Minister for Emergency Situations Yury Vorobyov --
Unfortunately over the past six years , the rule of the Taliban turned Afghanistan into a center of terrorism and drugs .
The struggle against terrorism and against drugs , and the establishment of security is a priority for the Administration of Afghanistan .
But combating terrorism and drugs requires joint efforts .
Peace and stability in Afghanistan is not only in the interests of the Afghani people and nation but of all the countries in the region .
Afghanistan 's interim government stated that it would take firm measures very quickly to prevent the harvest of poppy in the wake of the Taliban regime 's fall late last year .
Leader of Afghanistan 's interim government Hamid Karzai said the fight against poppy harvesting and the lucrative trafficking of opium and heroin will be a top priority .
The anti - drug effort is strongly supported by Western countries , whose populations are a major market for heroin and opium from Afghanistan .
February 28 , 2002 Kabul officials announced that Afghan police are creating their first anti - narcotics units with the help of the United Nations due to concern that the country could again become a major producer of opium .
February 28 , 2002 Qanooni stated in talks with Russian Interior Minister Boris Gryzlov that Afghanistan 's main task is to prevent future drugs production .
Qanooni outlined a three - stage plan of action --
Afghan authorities will seek to ban poppy harvesting .
Afghan authorities will strengthen the borders around Afghanistan .
Afghan authorities will cooperate with the security forces of neighboring states .
Afghanistan is thought to be responsible for 75 percent of the world 's opium and 80 percent of the heroin traded illegally in Europe .
Approximately 11000 Russian guards patrol the 1200 - kilometre ( 750 - mile ) border between Russia and Afghanistan under a 1992 agreement signed by Moscow and Dushanbe .
The Northern Alliance opposes the Taliban but tolerated the harvest of poppy in territory it controlled .
Afghanistan 's interim government has been in power for 2 months .

South Korea 's defense ministry under attack in parliament over allegations it is favoring U.S. company Boeing for multi - billion - dollar fighter project .
Newspaper reports reveal that French - made plane was rated higher in air force evaluations and that the Government is instead responding to political pressure from the U.S. and Boeing .
South Korea 's Defense Ministry came under attack in Parliament on 04 March 2002 over allegations that it is favoring U.S. company Boeing for a multi - billion - dollar fighter project .
Ruling and opposition lawmakers criticized the Ministry as newspapers reported that the French - made fighter Rafale had scored the highest marks of any of the 4 contenders in field tests performed by South Korean Air Force evaluators .
The 3.2 billion U.S. dollar project to buy 40 fighters will be one of the most important international military contracts awarded this year but it has encountered multiple obstacles .
Award of the contract was temporarily suspended in February 2002 after the prices offered by 4 bidders were judged too high .
South Korea 's defense ministry promised to conclude its first - stage appraisal by the end of March 2002 .
There has also been much newspaper speculation that the South Korean government might yield to U.S. pressure to buy Boeing 's aged F - 15 k.
Speculation grew in February 2002 when Defense Minister Kim Dong - Shin stressed that South Korea should consider security ties with the United States in the project .
The other competing planes are the Dassault firm 's Rafale , the Eurofighter Consortium 's typhoon 2000 and the Russian Su - 32 made by Sukhoi .
Dassault is seeking its first foreign order for the Rafale .
Kang Chang - Sung of the opposition Grand National Party expressed doubt of the fairness of the evaluation methods stating that his party suspects that the Defense Ministry has political reasons to select the F - 15 k.
The ruling Millennium Democratic Party also accused the Ministry of favoring the F - 15 k despite the defense chief 's insistence that there was no favoritism toward Boeing .
Kim stated --
There has been no pressure from the United States .
There would be an investigation into how classified documents had been leaked .
The Defense Ministry was further pressured by numerous newspaper reports of the Air Force 's evaluation of the Rafale as excellent in all categories .
Newspapers stated that the F - 15 k was rated excellent in reliability and support combat capability but met only 30 percent of core technology requirements .
Newspapers stated that the Eurofighter was rated excellent in general function and reliability categories but the Rafale also earned the excellent rating for its weapons and electronic warfare capability .
The Su - 35 placed fourth with ratings of ordinary in all five categories .
Rafale reportedly offered more generous terms for technology transfer and subcontracts for South Korea 's aerospace industry .
The Ministry stated that the air force was just 1 of 4 evaluations .
Some analysts have stated that the study method is biased toward Boeing noting that the evaluation was revised in February 2002 to ensure that all 4 bidders would receive an automatic 60 points for technology transfer .
The English - language Korea Herald newspaper stated that this revision gives an advantage to Boeing which has been reluctant to transfer core technology .
The Korea Herald stated that when evaluators were conducting their first - stage reports the ministry ordered them to give each bidder grades within a range of 60 to 100 points instead of 0 to 100 points .
The Korea Herald stated that critics say Boeing would benefit most from the points minimum because it would gain fewer points than Dassault in terms of technology transfer and subcontracts .

A senior South Korean minister on Friday warned that there could be a new crisis this year over inspections of the rival North 's nuclear program .
Senior South Korean minister Jeong Se - hyun on 020329 warned that tensions could rise because North Korea wants inspections of its nuclear facilities delayed .
Unification Minister Jeong is the South Korean government 's chief policymaker for relations with North Korea .
Jeong said in a lecture on South Korea and US relations with North Korea that there was some talk in the United States that the nuclear inspection in North Korea should be carried out in 020800 .
North Korea 's suggestion is that the inspection should be delayed until 050000 .
Jeong said that a crisis could come in 020800 on the Korean peninsula if this issue becomes an international point of contention .
Following Jeong 's comments another senior government official sought to play down Jeong 's remarks about the looming troubles .
The unnamed official told the Yonhap national news agency that talk of pressing for IAEA inspections in 020800 had come only from private researchers in the United States .
The official said it was speculation that the North Korean government thinks the inspections should be delayed until 050000 .
Top South Korean envoy Lim Won - dong intends to raise international concerns about the North 's nuclear and missile programs when he goes to Pyongyang 020403 .
Lim is a special advisor to President Kim Dae - jung on national security and foreign affairs .
Lim has also warned of a looming nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula .
Military officials said Lim intimated the problems could be as serious as a 940000 nuclear standoff over North Korea 's suspected nuclear weapons development that came close to conflict .
The North Korean government agreed to freeze the North Korean nuclear program under an accord with a US - led international consortium .
The consortium is to build 2 light water nuclear reactors that produce less weapons grade fuel than North Korea 's old graphite reactors and provide substitute fuel until they are built .
The original 030000 target date for completion has been put back at least 5 years because of major political and construction delays .
The 940000 Accord stipulated that the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) must be allowed to inspect North Korea 's old facilities to see if plutonium has been processed before the core facilities of the new reactors are installed .

The Daily Telegraph reported on 08 April 2002 that declassified British Ministry of Defense documents explain how to make an atomic bomb .
The Daily Telegraph reports that the documents became public domain over the past 5 years .
The declassified documents are available to the public and could therefore be consulted by terrorists .
The Daily Telegraph reports that the documents give details of the manufacture of Britain 's first nuclear bomb at the end of the 1940s and start of the 1950s .
The declassified documents provide a list of the ingredients for such a weapon including the amount of plutonium necessary and how to spark off a chain reaction .
Britain 's first nuclear bomb was called Blue Danube .
Former engineer who worked on Britain 's military nuclear program Brian Burnell stated that the instructions could enable a terrorist to construct a rudimentary atomic bomb .
The Telegraph reported that the principle challenge would be obtaining the necessary plutonium but that several outlaw states like Iraq might possess plutonium .
Terror organizations like al-Qaeda have tried to obtain plutonium .
Burnell was quoted as stating that the documents should never have been declassified and after the events of 11 September 2001 there is a case for removing them from public access .
The Telegraph stated that opposition Conservative Party defense spokesman Bernard Jenkin immediately called for explanations from the Labour government calling the documents a monstrous free gift to terrorists .

The number of heroin addicts in Tajikistan has vastly increased over the past five years due to drug trafficking between Afghanistan and Russia and Europe .
The number of heroin addicts in Tajikistan has vastly increased over the past five years due to drug trafficking between Afghanistan and Europe .
The majority of the heroin is grown in neighboring Afghanistan .
Afghanistan is the world 's top opium producer .
Tajikistan shares a 1300 - kilometer ( 800 - mile ) border with Afghanistan and has become a transit point for heroin being trafficked into Russia and Europe .
In 2001 the Russian army and Tajik police confiscated nearly 9 tons of drugs and arrested more than 2000 people .
The Russian army guards Tajikistan 's border with Afghanistan .
The majority of Tajikistan 's heroin addicts live in cities and are aged between 18 and 25 .
75 percent of Tajikistan 's population lives in rural areas , where heroin addicts are frequently ostracized .
Head of a public drug clinic in Dushanbe , Tajikistan Andrei Onishchenko , stated --
There are 5000 heroin addicts officially registered in Tajikistan , compared with 57 in 1997 .
The actual figure is seven times greater than the official number .
The low cost and availability of heroin are among the causes of the addiction problem .
One dose of heroin costs less than a dollar in Tajikistan , which is less than the price of a bottle of the local vodka .
an addict who has been using heroin for 2 years needs to use 3 grams of heroin every 24 hours .
3 grams of heroin costs 70 somonis or 30 dollars .
an addict is willing to commit any crime to pay for heroin .
Afghan heroin is the strongest in the world because it is made from poppies cultivated at high altitudes and therefore subjected to high doses of ultra - violet light .
A person who takes a daily dose of Afghan heroin has a life expectancy of between 5 and 7 years and many commit suicide before that .
The Tajik State pays 25 dirams ( a few cents ) per day for every person in the rehabilitation clinics .
The percentage of relapses is very high due to the lack of followup treatment and unemployment among young people .
Head of a Tajik government agency that fights drug trafficking Avaz yuldachev stated that heroin users are ill and need treatment .
Anvar , a 14 - year - old boy from Dushanbe , used heroin for three years before being hospitalized in Onishchenko 's drug clinic .
Anvar said --
He sniffed a white substance he found in his backyard and was unable to stop .
He stopped going to school .
He stole from the local market to get money for more heroin .
Drug traffickers face the death penalty under Tajik law .
Tajikistan has 6.2 million inhabitants .

AFP , members of international and local press , and United Nations representatives and diplomats witnessed Myanmar destroy illicit drugs the authorities captured .
Junta spokesman Colonel Hla Min stated that Myanmar became poor because of their trying to be so clean .
Min took pictures of millions of dollars worth of poppy seeds , refined drugs and precursor chemicals curling up in smoke .
AFP , members of international and local press , and United Nations representatives and diplomats witnessed Myanmar destroy illicit drugs the authorities captured .
Min said Myanmar would be one of the richest countries in the region if they were as corrupt as outsiders claimed .
Hla Min stated that illicit drugs worth some 50 billion dollars have been destroyed by authorities since 1974 .
Min said it was enough to pay Myanmar 's national debt ten times over .
Drug - burning ceremonies are regular events in Myanmar .
Critics argue that it does not reflect the massive drug industry in the country .
Resident Representative of the UN 's Drug Control Program ( UNDCP ) Jean - Luc Lemahieu said this one is different .
Almost 102 tons of poppy seeds were burnt in the capital of Myanmar 's northern Shan state at this ceremony .
The ceremony also included 249 kilograms of opium , 102 kilograms of morphine powder , three kilograms of solid morphine and various precursor chemicals .
Lemahieu said that this ceremony had less processed opium and heroin than opium seeds .
It made it more symbolic and indicated the willingness of those directly involved to eliminate the opium .
The destruction forms part of the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control 's project new destiny .
It aims to prevent poppy cultivation by distributing seeds for substitution crops .
Farmers have been asked to grow seven kinds of alternative crops across 21,969 acres ( 8,891 hectares ) of land instead of opium .
Global narcotics authorities declared Myanmar the world 's largest producer of opium in 2001 .
They accounted for as much as 60 percent of global supply .
Myanmar beat Afghanistan because the Taliban militia 's enforced ban on opium poppies decreased Afghan production by 90 percent .
Critics said the Myanmar regime overlooks much of the production and trafficking in drugs by ethnic insurgent groups .
In particular the largest armed drug militia in the world the United Wa State Army .
Myanmar 's Home Minister Colonel Tin Hlaing said the success of project new destiny is evidenced by the tons of poppy seeds that have been turned in rather than seized .
Hlaing stated his confidence in the drug scourge that threatens the world will not find a place in Myanmar if the local population is committed to this sort of cooperation .
Lauk Kai is one of the regime 's showpieces for its previous crop substitution programs .
It has expanses of rubber trees , fruit orchards and paddy where poppies used to thrive .
The poppies yielded the raw ingredient for heroin .
Lauk Kai is located in the infamous Golden Triangle .
Reformed drug lord and leader of the Kokang phone Kyar Shin pledged commitment to the government program .
The Kokang comprise the majority of the population in Myanmar .
Phone Kyar Shin predicts that starting today there will be no destruction ceremony in the future because no more poppy will be grown .
Phone Kyar Shin said this at another ceremony that destroyed more than 12 tons of poppy seed .
Phone Kyar Shin appealed for help from the international community .
The international community is reluctant to give help .
Phone Kyar Shin requested the distinguished guests to understand Myanmar 's situation more and give practical advice and support .
UNDCP 's Lemahieu when asked by AFP what impact project New Destiny had on the international community hoped it would have a positive impact and that some additional funds would come forward .
Lemahieu said so much depends on the political situation in this country .
There is hope for further political change following the May 6 release of pro - democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from 19 months house arrest .
The regime seeks the United States approval for the project .
Its global announcement comes via the regime 's newly - appointed public relations firm in Washington .
The US charge d'affaires Priscilla Clapp said maybe because it has to be a multi - faceted , sustained effort for it to work and that there should be measurable results .

Ecological organization Greenpeace stated on June 21 , 2002 that Russia helped Iran to develop nuclear weapons by building Iran 's Bushehr atomic power station .
The Russian branch of Greenpeace distributed a report at a press conference of Russia 's atomic energy ministry .
The ministry conceded that the Russo - Iranian accord on the plant 's construction does not require the repatriation of the nuclear fuel .
The report stated that the recycling of nuclear fuel from Bushehr is not mentioned in the accord between the Russian and Iranian governments on the construction of the plant .
Greenpeace member Vladimir Chuprov said the ministry had practically admitted that Iran will not return to Russia the spent nuclear fuel from the power station and Russia 's only use for Iran is to equip itself with nuclear weapons .
The atomic energy ministry confirmed the report 's existence and strongly denied Greenpeace 's accusations .
Ministry spokesman Nikolai Shingarev told AFP that Russia would only supply nuclear fuel to Iran on condition that it be returned to Russia after its use .
Shingarev said Russia is currently in negotiations with Iran .
This issue will be settled before the power station comes into operation .
Shingarev said the accord on Bushehr was signed before Russia passed a law permitting the import of nuclear waste last year .
This explains why the accord makes no mention of the return of the fuel .
Shingarev said it is very difficult to make a nuclear weapon from the plutonium in this fuel .
The United States and Israel fear that the Russian - Iranian nuclear cooperation could enable Tehran to acquire the technology needed to build nuclear weapons .
Russia dismisses this accusation .
Iran ordered the power station in 1994 at a cost of nearly 800 million dollars ( 860 million euros ) from Russia .
Iran has said the plant is being built only for civilian energy purposes and allows regular inspections of Bushehr by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Experts say Bushehr could in theory become operational as early as September 2003 .
Currently it is equipped with a single reactor .
German group Siemens pulled out of the long - standing project at the request of the German government after Iran 's 1979 Islamic Revolution .

Malaysia proposes expansion of anti - terrorism pact with Indonesia and the Philippines to entire ASEAN .
Terrorism is expanding across Southeast Asia .
The Malaysian Government proposes the expansion of an anti - terrorism pact with Indonesia and the Philippines to encompass the remainder of Southeast Asia .
Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar stated that other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) will be encouraged to accede to the pact at talks next week with ASEAN foreign ministers in Brunei .
Syed Hamid stated that Thailand , Laos and Singapore had expressed interest in joining the pact .
Malaysian defense analyst dzirhan mahadzir stated --
Cooperation by poorer countries may be stymied by financial constraints and a perception that terrorism does not directly affect these countries .
An ASEAN pact is beneficial in the long - term but will be difficult to implement because national security issues and interstate rivalry may make some of ASEAN 's 10 members wary to divulge information .
ASEAN must agree on a definition of terrorism to identify the common enemy .
20020500 senior ASEAN members Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines signed an anti - terror security pact intended to initiate the eradication of terrorism from the region .
The 3 countries share sea borders frequently used by pirates and criminals in evading pursuing troops .

Mushahid Ali of the Singapore - based Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies stated --
The trilateral pact between Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines constituted a constructive first step .
Indonesia and other ASEAN members must more proactively monitor terrorist activities and establish a concrete mechanism among national agencies for the protracted conflict .
20020500 ASEAN security ministers at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur failed to agree on a definition of terrorism but agreed to increase cooperation among State enforcement agencies and endorsed the use of detention without trial for suspected militants in Malaysia and Singapore .
Objections were raised concerning Malaysia 's proposal to include State terrorism in the definition .
Dzirhan stated --
The agreement among Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines may have been aimed at ingratiating the countries to the US rather than combating terrorism .
Since the pact was signed no progress has occurred .
The creation of a formalized security structure in combating terror will be decelerated by the ASEAN 's model of acting on consensus .
Officials stated that after the meeting in Brunei 20020728-20020801 ASEAN and its major western trading partners are expected to demand freezing of terror funds and stronger counter - terrorism cooperation .
Dozens of suspected terrorists allegedly linked to al-Qaeda in Malaysia , Singapore and the Philippines have revealed the existence of a regional Islamic militant group called the Jemaah Islamiyah , which also operates in Indonesia .
Southeast Asia is now suspected as a potential new haven for al-Qaeda operatives escaping US and allied attacks in Afghanistan and elsewhere .

On 021015 officials stated that all Vietnam - based websites will require a license to operate in Vietnam in new Vietnamese government efforts to control the dissemination of reactionary or pornographic material online .
Do Quy Doan stated to Agence France - Presse that the newly - imposed website licensing rule seeks to prevent harmful information from threatening Vietnamese culture and national security .
Do Quy Doan is a spokesman for the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture and Information .
Do Quy Doan stated that the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture and Information will take 30 days to license eligible websites that do not include pornographic material , information that harms the national security or encourages violence and anti - government activities .
Diplomatic , foreign and press institutions must obtain permission from the Vietnamese Foreign Affairs Ministry before applying for licenses permitting them to distribute content online in Vietnam .
Do Quy Doan stated that any Vietnam - based website must clearly display the website licensing number and date on its homepage .
Writers and intellectuals in Vietnam have increasingly employed the Internet to distribute news or opinion banned from the tightly - controlled Vietnamese state press .
The number of Internet users in Vietnam is rapidly increasing and could reach 5 percent of its 79 million residents by 050000 .
As of 020600 there were only 175000 registered Internet users in Vietnam .
Registered Internet users in Vietnam increased by 30 percent from 010000 to 020600 .

Atomic Energy Agency director States it would be difficult for Iraq to conceal a nuclear weapons program if international inspectors were allowed to return .
Inspectors would perform various tests , visits , and interviews and their presence alone in the country would be a deterrent .
On 18 October 2002 International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) director Mohamed ElBaradei stated it is unlikely that Iraq could conceal a nuclear weapons program if it allowed international inspectors to return .
ElBaradei stated that once inspectors were working in Iraq their presence alone would be a deterrent to developing nuclear weapons .
ElBaradei stated to reporters at his headquarters in Vienna --
It is difficult to conceal a nuclear program if thorough inspections are performed because nuclear products always have a signature .
Traces are always visible if highly enriched uranium or plutonium were used .
ElBaradei stated that inspectors would perform environmental sampling , gamma radiation surveys from helicopters , internal periodic visits to all capable sites and interviews with all former nuclear scientists to confirm that they are not working in the nuclear program .
ElBaradei stated that the IAEA could not give a 100 percent guarantee but that the presence of inspectors would be a good deterrent and a good mechanism for detection .
ElBaradei stated --
It is necessary to control imports to Iraq because of the risk that Iraq is receiving nuclear material from outside the country .
There must be physical protection of all nuclear material particularly in the former Soviet Union .
There must be strong unanimous support by the UN Security Council to force Iraq to comply with IAEA inspection .
The IAEA must be given as much intelligence information as possible to guide inspectors to anything that should be inspected or to any item hidden from inspectors .
The Security Council has been meeting in open session to discuss the Iraq issue before the vote on conditions under which UN weapons inspectors will return to Baghdad to verify Iraqi assertions that it does not possess nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .
UN weapons inspectors departed Baghdad in 1998 .

Bangladesh opposition claims a crime crackdown being carried out by the army is becoming political witchhunt , and human rights groups claim fundamental rights are being violated .
Bangladesh 's main opposition leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed said 021102 that an army crackdown on crime was turning into a political witchhunt and targeting her Awami League party .
Troops were ordered into the streets more than 2 weeks ago to eliminate rampant crime but human rights groups claim fundamental rights are being trampled .
Newspapers and rights groups put the toll of those who have died in police and military custody at 16 .
Officials say more than 3400 people have been taken into custody since the crackdown began 021017 .
The government has confirmed the deaths of 12 people due to heart attacks .
Relatives allege some suspects have been tortured in custody .
The US government and London - based Amnesty International have also expressed concern about the custodial deaths .
Amnesty urged a prompt and fair investigation by an independent body into the deaths .
Sheikh Hasina told reporters at the airport on her return from a private trip to the United States and Europe that initially it appeared to be a neutral anti - crime drive and the opposition Awami League party welcomed it .
Hasina said the crackdown is gradually turning into one to eliminate the Opposition .
Hasina wants the military to arrest real criminals and not violate Bangladesh 's constitution and human rights because of concern about such violations in the name of anti - crime drive .
Sheikh Hasina said the military has to operate within the laws of the land as no one is above the law .
Police said the army hadon 021101 arrested former state minister and Awami League lawmaker talukder Abdul khaleque in southwestern Khulna city soon after he spoke at a news conference against the deployment .
The Daily Star newspaper reported that an imam and a local leader of fundamentalist group Jamaat - e - Islami were also arrested on 021101 in Khulna .
Former minister and Awami League lawmaker Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and Sheikh Hasina 's Political Secretary ex - minister Saber Hossain Chowdhury were arrested 021000 along with independent MP Hemayet Ullah aurango .
Selim , Chowdhury and aurango are being detained under the strict 740000 Special Powers Act allowing detention for 120 days without charge .
Sheikh Hasina questioned how 3 of the Awami League party 's ex - ministers could be terrorists .
Hasina was apparently unaware of the claims of the arrest of the Jamaat leader when adding that it is an open secret that the Jamaat - e - Islami and the Jamaat - e - Islami student wing have weapons and wondering why none of the Jamaat - e - Islami has been arrested so far .
Hasina said the Awami League party would raise the issue when parliament reconvenes 021114 .
Bangladesh 's Prime Minister Khaleda Zia 's Islamist - allied government includes 2 cabinet ministers from the Jamaat .
Zia 's administration denies the drive is politically biased and stresses that activists from ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) have also been detained .
A young BNP activist died 021101 in a hospital after being interrogated by the army .
Police said the activist was wanted in a number of cases .

The Russian government hailed cooperation of Arab countries in fighting terrorism and said not one Arab state backed the Chechen separatists who are accused of waging a terrorist campaign .
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) Secretary General Abdel Rahman al-Attiya held talks on 021104 .
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Yakovenko said afterward that not a single Arab country supports rebels in Chechnya .
Yakovenko said the Russian Government finds it inadmissible to link individual States or religions with terrorism or extremism and is grateful to those Arab states which are trying to cooperate with Russian law enforcement agencies to cut channels for funding terrorist organizations .
The Russian government has consistently sought to portray its campaign against a separatist insurgency in Chechnya as part of the global war on terrorism and says that rebel groups are receiving backing from the terrorist Al-Qaeda network and from shadowy Islamic radical groups based in countries such as Saudi Arabia .
A senior Kremlin official said last week that the Russian Government might ask the GCC State Qatar to extradite Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev .
Yandarbiyev is a former Chechen Vice - President and aide to rebel president Aslan Maskhadov .
The Russian government accuses Yandarbiyev of involvement in the 041000 hostage - taking in a Moscow theater .
Russian government spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Qatar 's response would demonstrate the extent of that country 's willingness to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism .
Yakovenko said that stronger ties between Russia and the GCC States could play a special role in combating international terrorism .
Ivanov said al-Attiya 's visit will contribute to increased cooperation between the Russian government and the six Arab monarchies of the Gulf region .
Ivanov said the Russian government wanted to strengthen its ties with the Gulf countries and that these ties have begun to strengthen recently .
Ivanovalso said the Russian government would like to develop them further and particularly in areas of mutual interest .
The Russian government has traditionally been close to the Arab side in the Middle East conflict and has spoken strongly against US armed intervention against Iraq in the stand - off over disarmament .
Yakovenko said that Al-Attiya 's talks with Russian government officials 021104 and 021105 were likely to focus on oil issues and noted that both the Russian government and the Gulf countries are interested in stable world prices .
Yakovenko said the main emphasis of the talks will be on Russia 's possible involvement in the implementation of regional projects run by the Council and said that there will be particular emphasis on finding peaceful , political and diplomatic ways to settle the Iraqi issue .
Al-Attiya also plans to hold talks with economic ministers and senior officials such as the head of the Chamber of Commerce Yevgeny Primakov and the Chairman of the Russian employers ' association Arkady Volsky .

Tanzanian Vice President Ali Mohamed Sheni said on November 12 , 2002 that Africa needs its own health forum to create research priorities to effectively combat disease on the continent .
Sheni stated that Africa will find it difficult to influence global research priorities in its favor without a forum .
The continent lacks resources .
Sheni attended a four - day meeting to discuss global health at Arusha in northern Tanzania .
Sheni addressed more than 700 public health specialists from 100 countries .
Sheni told delegates at the Global Forum for Health Research 's annual meeting that less than 10 percent of the global health research budget of 70 billion dollars went to Africa .
Africa has 90 percent of the global diseases .
Sheni said the formation of the Asian and Pacific Health Research Forum and the Latin American Health Research Forum are steps in the right direction .
Global Forum for Health Research Chairman Richard Feachem said it was unfair for poor countries to be allocated meager sums of research funding .
Feachem said the majority of the poor are getting little health research funding compared to the wealthy few .
The Global Forum for Health Research is an independent , international foundation funded by the Rockefeller Foundation , the World Health Organization , the World Bank and the Governments of Canada , Denmark , Netherlands , Norway , Sweden and Switzerland .

New U.S. study claims that one - tenth of Internet 's sites are blocked by the Chinese Government authorities using updated Filtering technology .
A wide range of sites including a very high percentage of news sites and keywords were found to be blocked .
A U.S. study released on 03 December 2002 states that one - tenth of the Internet 's sites may be blocked by Chinese authorities as part of efforts to prevent access to information on dissidents , Taiwan , Tibet and other subjects .
The study was conducted by Harvard University 's berkman Center for Internet and society .
The study found that more than 50000 of the approximately 200000 websites tested were inaccessible from at least 1 point in China on at least 1 occasion .
Using a more narrow definition of blocked site the study concluded that 18931 websites were being blocked to Chinese web users .
Harvard researcher and co - author of the report Ben Edelman stated that it is likely that similar percentages apply to the Internet as a whole .
Edelman told AFP that it is highly likely that approximately one - tenth of the Internet is filtered by or recently has been filtered by China .
Edelman stated that there are many different ways to measure this effect and therefore hesitated to specify any single proportion .
The latest study was broader than prior surveys and gives perspective to disparate reports about websites that are filtered or blocked by China .
In the report it is concluded that --
China blocks a range of web content beyond that which is sexually explicit .
1000s of sites providing information about news , health , education , and entertainment were blocked .
Approximately 3284 sites from Taiwan were blocked .
The blocked sites also included those of U.S. news organizations including ABC News and CBS News , the Alta Vista search engine , and a number of U.S. universities .
The researchers found that 100 percent of the top 10 sites with keywords Tibet , Taiwan China , or equality were blocked .
A large number of other sites with keywords such as freedom , democracy and HIV were also blocked .
The BBC news site was consistently unavailable .
Sites for CNN , Time magazine , U.S. - based public broadcasting system , the Miami Herald , and the Philadelphia Inquirer were also often blocked .
The report found that 42 of google 's top 100 results for news were blocked .
Religious sites blocked in China included the Asian American Baptist Church , The atheist network , the Catholic Civil Rights League , Feng Shui , the Jewish Federation of Winnipeg , and the Denver Zen center .
China has an estimated 45 million Internet users .
China has been widely criticized in the West for blocking websites and for imprisoning people for viewing banned sites or using the Internet for anti - government activities .
The Chinese government is believed to routinely block a large number of foreign - based sites primarily those featuring dissident views or banned groups such as the Falungong spiritual organization but also certain foreign news sites and pages showing pornography .
A recent report by the U.S. - based Rand Corporation think tank found that the Chinese government now uses more technology to filter out objectionable content rather than relying solely on surveillance of users and seizure of equipment as it did in the past .
The rand report released earlier in 2002 found that Chinese authorities now appear to have more effective technology for filtering out undesirable content .

A laboratory chief from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said on December 10 , 2002 that the UN 's nuclear agency could detect infinitesimal amounts of radiation from weapons programs if they exist in samples from Iraq .
David Donohue spoke at the IAEA laboratory in Seibersdorf on the southwest outskirts of Vienna .
Donohue said the equipment can detect particles down to the picogram ( a millionth of a millionth of a gram ) .
The first samples from Iraq are due to arrive to the laboratory this week .
IAEA and other UN inspectors have been taking soil , water and air samples since November 27 , 2001 at Iraqi sites suspected of being used for programs to make weapons of mass destruction .
Donohue said samples will be sent for corroboration to labs in France , the US , the UK ( Britain ) , Japan and Russia if IAEA finds any traces of radiation from enriched uranium or plutonium , or any chemical and biological agents .
Donohue said it is very difficult to manipulate radioactive isotopes without leaving a trail .
A trail will be left even if it 's only ultra - traces .
The IAEA is the UN agency charged with monitoring nuclear activity .

South Korea urges North Korea to return nuclear reactor to UN surveillance .
North Korea had violated 1994 shut down by disabling surveillance devices .
20021222 South Korea urged North Korea to return the Yongbyon nuclear reactor to UN surveillance in order to deescalate the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula .
20021221 the UN International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) stated that North Korea had disabled IAEA surveillance devices by breaking seals on IAEA equipment and blocking surveillance cameras at the country 's 5 megawatt nuclear reactor .
20021221 IAEA Director General General Mohammed ElBaradei expressed regret over North Korea 's actions .
A South Korean Foreign Ministry official stated --
The development is regrettable and will increase tension over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program .
Japan and the United States should act jointly with South Korea .
The IAEA stated that ElBaradei warned the government of North Korea not to take further action that would prevent the IAEA from monitoring compliance with the 1994 accord with the United States shutting down the reactor .
20041212 North Korea stated that the country 's plutonium - producing nuclear program would recommence in order to produce energy due to a global embargo on oil shipments .
In 1994 the reactor was frozen under an accord in exchange for 500000 tons of fuel oil annually from the United States .
The accord additionally formed a consortium to build 2 light - water reactors .
International experts stated that the Yongbyon reactor was used to produce weapons - grade plutonium .
After the 1994 closing approximately 8000 spent fuel rods from the reactor were sealed in metal casings in cooling ponds .
20041000 the United States revealed that North Korea had admitted to implementing a nuclear program based on enriched uranium , a material for nuclear weapons .

North Korea removed UN seals at a laboratory suspected of being used to produce weapons - grade material .
This activity further escalates tension in the Korean Peninsula 's nuclear crisis and ignores international condemnation .
A source close to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said late on 021223 the North had started stripping the UN nuclear regulation group 's seals and monitoring equipment from the laboratory at Yongbyon .
The lab is suspected of having reprocessed fuel rods for weapons - grade plutonium before its activities were frozen under a 940000 arms control deal with the United Sates .
The source is fully informed of IAEA activities in North Korea and said the North Koreans are cutting the seals of the nuclear fuel reprocessing laboratory and could complete it possibly by 021224 .
The move followed similar actions 021221-021222 at the Yongbyon nuclear facility during which the North Korean government took control of 1000s of spent fuel rods that could be used to make nuclear weapons .
The nuclear crisis dominated the first meeting between South Korean President Kim Dae - Jung and President - elect Roh Moo - hyun earlier 021223 .
Kim and Roh were meeting for the first time since Roh 's election last week and the meeting was supposed to focus on smoothing over the 030225 transfer of power between the outgoing and incoming leaders .
The 90 - minute talks instead centered on the North Korean government 's latest standoff with the international community .
President Kim 's spokeswoman Park Sun - sook said that Kim and Roh 's discussion was pinned down on international relations which focused on North Korea 's nuclear issue .
The South Korean government 's frustration with the North Korean government was evident in a foreign ministry statement which urged the North Korean government to restore the seals and disabled monitoring cameras on the rods .
The statement said that the North Korean government took further actions to unfreeze its nuclear activities despite repeated warnings from the South Korean government and the international community and was raising regional tension and amplifying international concerns over nuclear proliferation .
The United States responded to that development with swift condemnation .
US State Department spokesman Louis Fintor said the over 8000 spent fuel rods are of particular concern because they can be reprocessed to recover plutonium for nuclear weapons .
US Senator Richard Lugar said the North Korean government was creating a very dangerous situation , initially for South Korea and for Japan but ultimately for the United States .
Lugar will head the Senate 's Foreign Relations Committee in 030000 .
The United States has been stepping up international pressure on the North Korean government since 021222 .
Deputy US Ambassador Evans Revere met South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Tai - sik in Seoul on 021223 to discuss countermeasures to be taken against the North Korean government following the US and South Korean foreign ministers ' urgent talks over the phone .
Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi also expressed the widespread international alarm about the North Korean government 's regrettable latest move .
Analysts have said North Koreans could extract some 25 kilograms ( 55 pounds ) of weapons - grade plutonium for at least 3 nuclear weapons from the irradiated rods .
The North Korean government said it unfroze its nuclear facilities because it was in a desperate energy crisis aggravated by the suspension of fuel oil shipments .
The US government said the spent plutonium has nothing to do with power generation .
The United States and North Korea came close to war over the North Korean government 's plutonium program in the early 1990s .
The confrontation was defused when the US and North Korean Governments signed the 940000 agreed framework .
That accord has been undermined since the North Korean government admitted in 021000 to running a new , secret and separate program based on enriched uranium .
The US government cut its fuel aid to the North Korea in retaliation .

The UN atomic agency said such moves were tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship .
South Korean President Kim Dae Jung told officials that North Korea 's shifting of unspent fuel rods into a building housing a reactor capable of producing weapons - grade plutonium aggravated an already - tense situation .
Kim Dae Jung and officials assembled at an urgent national security meeting .
Kim Dae Jung said that North Korea moved to restart frozen nuclear facilities despite the international community 's efforts for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue .
This further aggravated the situation .
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said the shift of the rods was proactive .
Plutonium could be extracted for making nuclear warheads within months .
The United States dismissed the action as nuclear blackmail .
There was strong criticism from the United Nations ' International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
Beginning last week IAEA saw its monitoring equipment disabled and seals removed from the nuclear facilities that had been dormant since a 1994 accord with the United States .
IAEA director Mohamed ElBaradei dismissed claims by North Korea 's government that it was only acting in the wake of an energy crisis in North Korea .
ElBaradei said that the reprocessing facility at Yongbyong is irrelevant to North Korea 's ability to produce electricity .
North Korea has no current legitimate peaceful use for plutonium given the status of its nuclear fuel cycle .
ElBaradei said restarting North Korea 's nuclear facilities without appropriate safeguards and towards producing plutonium raises serious non - proliferation concerns is tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship .
The move of 1,000 unspent rods into the reactor building is the latest action taken by the energy - starved North since the apparent collapse of a 1994 accord that froze its nuclear capacity .
The move is confirmed by both the UN agency and the South Korean Foreign Ministry .
The facility has the capacity for 8,000 rods .
All have been stored in a cooling pond at Yongbyon since the United States offered North Korea annual supplies of heavy fuel oil and two new light water nuclear reactors in return for Pyongyang 's agreement to freeze its nuclear operations at Yongbyon .
The eight - year - old deal has fallen apart following US revelations in October 2002 that North Korea had admitted to running a separate nuclear program based on enriched uranium technology in violation of the accord .
North Korea is bankrupt and on the brink of economic collapse .
It has been pushing for negotiations with the United States .
Experts say North Korea needs aid and security guarantees from the United States to ensure its survival .
Throughout the nuclear dispute North Korea has said it is ready to sit down and talk with the United States and even to refreeze its Yongbyon program .
President Kim has been pushing the United States to accept the offer under Kim 's sunshine policy of engagement with the North .
President Kim has criticized the United States for previously sidelining South Korea in handling North Korea and said South Korea should take a leading role .
Kim was critical of the US handling of the stand - off when eight years ago the United States and North Korea drew back from the brink of war over Pyongyang 's plutonium program .
The President has complained that South Korea was sidelined during the entire dispute and ended up paying a multi - billion dollar bill for the light - water reactors .
Kim 's chief security adviser Yim Sung - joon said the President instructed that North Korea should take lead because the North Korean nuclear issue is important to the Korean peninsula .
This was said in a statement after December 26 , 2002 's meeting .
The United States said it would stand up to nuclear blackmail and has ruled out negotiations .
The US pledged not to reward bad behavior .
Experts have joined the IAEA in dismissing the idea that North Korea was relaunching the reactor for energy purposes .
Director General for International institutions at the ministry in Seoul Chun Young - Woo said it would produce at its peak enough for one large office building which is a negligible amount .

Experts warn that North Korea could produce weapons - grade plutonium from spent fuel rods at re - opened nuclear reactor .
Existing rods could produce 3-6 atomic bombs in 6-8 months .
Experts stated that 8000 spent fuel rods reportedly stockpiled by North Korea at a nuclear reactor the country is threatening to re - start could be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons .
Experts stated that the rods could produce 3-6 atomic bombs in 6-8 months .
The IAEA stated that North Korea additionally moved 1000 fresh rods into the nuclear reactor as well .
The reactor could produce enough spent rods to construct 1 atomic bomb per year if reactivated .
The experimental nuclear plant in Yongbyon is a miniature of electricity - producing nuclear plants in Western countries but operates on the same principles .
The Yongbyon plant produces 5 megawatts .
Plants in France produce 1300 megawatts .
The Yongbyon plant is 100 km north of the North Korean capital Pyongyang .
Nuclear reactor process --
4 meter fuel rods containing uranium oxide are burned to initiate fission -- the nucleus of the uranium atom is split , releasing neutrons that collide with other atoms , creating more neutrons in a chain reaction .
Fission produces immense heat which is applied to water to create steam which drives turbines to generate electricity .
Plutonium and other radioactive byproducts of the process accumulate and decrease the effectiveness of the rods until they are spent after 3-4 years .
Spent rods consisting of highly radioactive plutonium and residual uranium are cooled in pools of water for several years to diminish radioactivity and then the plutonium is then recovered in nitrate form and converted into oxide .
The recovered plutonium can be mixed with uranium for reuse in the reactor or used in making nuclear weapons .
Nuclear experts stated that to make weapons , a high proportion of plutonium 239 ( military grade plutonium , as opposed to the commercial plutonium used in power plants ) must be extracted .

British officials are deeply concerned by a warning from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) concerning North Korea 's opening of the Yongbyon facility and possible nuclear intentions .
A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman said Thursday that the UK government is deeply concerned about the latest revelations in a warning by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) concerning North Korea 's possible nuclear intentions .
The comments came after the IAEA accused the North Korean government of nuclear brinkmanship and said the North Korean government had begun work to reactivate the Yongbyon reactor in breach of a 940000 agreement with the United States Government .
The UK Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said the UK government is in regular contact with international partners about the implications of the latest developments and is committed to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wherever it may occur .
The spokeswoman added that the North Korean government must comply with international obligations and eliminate nuclear weapons .
The IAEA has said the North Korean government had no current legitimate peaceful use for plutonium that could be produced at the newly reopened Yongbyon site that is capable of producing weapons - grade plutonium .
The IAEA said the North Koreans had moved 1000 fresh fuel rods into the Yongbyon reactor building .
Of more concern are the 8000 spent fuel rods at the facility they started unsealing 021215-021221 and the dismantling of IAEA monitoring equipment at the site .
Experts say the spent rods could be used to build 3-6 atomic bombs within 6-8 months .
The United States Government offered supplies of fuel oil and 2 new light water nuclear reactors in return for the North Korean government 's agreement to freeze nuclear operations under the 940000 agreed framework shutting down Yongbyon .
The agreement fell apart following US government revelations in 021000 that the North Korean government had admitted to a separate nuclear program based on enriched uranium technology .
The US government suspended oil shipments to North Korea as punishment .
The North Korean government in turn claimed to be in desperate need of power generation after the oil supplies were cut and began during 021215-021221 to unseal the spent fuel rods at the facility and to dismantle monitoring equipment .

US State Department spokeswoman Brenda Greenberg stated that attempts to restarts facilities would compound North Korea 's violations of these international commitments .
20030110 President George W. Bush is to send an envoy to Seoul do discuss defusing the crisis with Roh .
Roh will subsequently send an envoy to Washington .
Roh has advocated a peaceful resolution to the crisis through dialogue and has criticized the US hardline policy as potentially dangerous .
20021226 incoming Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Republican Senator Richard Lugar stated on NBC television that a US attack would be inadvisable because North Korea would likely retaliate with a potentially devastating attack on the Seoul area .
Roh 's aide acknowledged Lugar 's statement .
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer stated that Australia will suspend plans to open an embassy in Pyongyang to avoid appearing to condone North Korea 's nuclear actions .
20021226 IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei stated --
North Korea has moved 1,000 fresh fuel rods into the reactor building at Yongbyon -- which is capable of producing military plutonium -- as a prelude to reactivation .
North Korea has no use for plutonium in its civilian program and thus may be planning military activity .
The IAEA 's board of governors will shortly issue a report on the recent developments .
The Board was originally scheduled to meet 20030106 .

China launches unmanned space craft Shenzhou IV into a preset orbit with the eventual goal of sending astronauts into space .
30 December 2002 at 00:40 am -- China launched space craft Shenzhou IV into a preset orbit .
Shenzhou IV was launched by a Long March II F carrier rocket from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern Gansu province .
Chinese scientists announced Shenzhou IV would conduct experiments on the astronaut flight system and control of Shenzhou IV 's environment and life support system .
A Chinese aerospace official announced Shenzhou IV would return to Inner Mongolia within 7 days .
According to the Xinhua news agency the leading designer of the astronaut system for China 's manned space program commander Su Shuangning stated --
China will soon send astronauts to space .
Shenzhou IV is equipped to carry astronauts .
Chinese astronauts must first receive training in basic theories , professional skills and flight procedures and tasks .
In July 2002 the Pentagon announced --
China could send astronauts into space in 2003 .
China plans to build a reusable space vehicle similar to the US space shuttle .
14 Chinese astronauts have undergone training on Shenzhou space craft .
The Chinese astronauts were selected from thousands of air force pilots .
In 2001 Russia signed a 5 - year space cooperation agreement with China .
The agreement stipulates that Russia provide China with manned space craft technologies and train Chinese astronauts in Russian facilities .
In May 2002 official Chinese media announced that China plans to establish a base on the moon to exploit the Moon 's mineral resources .
Space expert at the French Institute for International Relations in Paris Laurence nardon stated --
US should not view China 's space manned program as a security threat .
China is a member of the ballistic missile club .
China 's space program is less of a world threat than India 's or Israel 's .
Some US researchers believe China is developing weaponization of its space technology .
China may be developing weaponization of its space technology but is not currently able to implement it .
China plans to put humans in space for prestige .
In November 2002 Chinese Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. President Zhang Qingwei stated --
Shenzhou III 's carrier rocket was equipped with a fault - detecting and handling system .
Shenzhou IV is backed by a ground - based search and rescue system and reinforced by other more reliable safety measures than Shenzhou III 's .
Designer of China 's spacecraft system Qi Faren announced --
The functions , indices and data relevant to manned flights tested well on three previous successful launches and landings of Shenzhou spaceships between 1999 and March 2002 .
China established a space program in 1992 .
Shenzhou I launched in November 1999 and returned to earth within one day .
10 January 2001 -- Shenzhou II launched .
Western analysts suspect re - entry failed .
25 March 2002 -- Shenzhou III launched .
The re - entry vehicle successfully returned to Inner Mongolia a week later .
Only the US and former USSR have sent humans into space .
Shenzhou IV is also referred to as Divine Vessel IV .

European Space Agency is finalizing deal with Russian government to allow for Soyuz rockets to be launched from Europe 's space command at Kourou , in French Guiana replacing phased - out Ariane - 4 launchers .
Plans for Soyuz launches have been delayed by funding issues since costly modifications to launch facilities must be made to accommodate the Russian rocket .
The European Space Agency ( ESA ) stated 10 January 2003 that it was finalizing a deal with the Russian government that could allow Soyuz rockets to be launched from Europe 's space command at Kourou , French Guiana .
The deal between the ESA and the Russian Government could be written as early as March 2003 and signed by the Russian government in April 2003 .
The deal would allow for Soyuz missiles to help replace phased - out Ariane - 4 launchers .
Ariane - 4 launchers send payloads up to 2.8 tons into geostationary orbit .
Spacecraft launched from Kourou benefit from the Earth 's full rotational speed on the equator to aid their trajectory into space .
With this extra momentum , the spacecraft require less fuel .
Plans for the Soyuz launches have been delayed by funding issues since modifications to be made to launch facilities in order to accommodate the Russian rocket are predicted to cost between 250 and 300 million euro .
The Russian space program has experienced funding problems and was unwilling to contribute one third of the bill as ESA had requested .
In November 2002 the Government of France proposed to fund the Russian Government 's share with a loan to be paid back by profits from the launches .
The ESA stated that no financial divisions have been decided yet .
France joined Russia in creating a joint company Starsem in 1996 to commercialize and market the Soyuz launches from Russia 's Baikonur Space Center in Kazakhstan .
Soyuz missiles used to send satellites and cosmonauts into space are the most used type of spacecraft .
Soyuz missiles have over 1700 launches since first launching the Sputnik satellite into orbit in 1957 .

Putin consented to Koizumi 's request and stated that dialogue with North Korean leader Kim Jong - Il was possible .
Koizumi stated that Russia , Japan , and the international community would benefit from improved bilateral relations if Russia and Japan could overcome previous disputes .
In 1945 the Soviet Union seized 4 Southern Kuril Islands still claimed by Japan .
Koizumi stated --
Japan will continue to assist Russia in dismantling weapons of mass destruction including decommissioned nuclear submarines for which Japan will allocate over 200 million dollars .
The weapons should be neutralized immediately in the interest of global security .
Japan will contribute 100 million dollars to the processing of weapons - grade plutonium to prevent appropriation by terrorists .
Japan has contributed 56 million dollars to scientific projects and will continue to cooperate with Russia .
Russia has previously refused to pressure North Korea over defense policy .
Analysts believe that Russia has limited authority to do so .

An Indian information technology expert disproved the phobia of cyber attacks and said the threat was overstated .
Director of the Indian Institute of Information Technology S. Sadagopan said the cyber attack is similar to the Y 2K myth ; although these things could happen , they will not happen .
Y 2K was a computer malfunction expected to occur when 1999 changed to 2000 but it did not inflict widespread damage .
Sadagopan addressed delegates at a conference on information security .
Sadagopan stated that these things happen with all technology if history is reviewed and that imaginative people can cause extraordinary problems even with primitive technology .
Sadagopan said the G 8 nations have lost 43 billion dollars due to cyber crime .
The G 8 nations are comprised of France , Britain , Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia and the United States .
Sadagopan said most people have an alarmist view of such attacks .
The attacks range from viruses , flame - mail ( abusive e-mail ) , stone throwing ( disfiguring a home page ) to cyber squatters and scripts for breaking into Internet sites .
Sadagopan stated that many sensitive installations such as nuclear and power plants , and missiles have an Internet protocol address and that once someone hacks into the sites one can trip the power lines or lead planes and missiles to their choice destinations .
Sadagopan added that this type of hacking is possible , but there is no need to panic .
Sadagopan said it needs to be recognized and while we should be sensitive about such threats it should not be sensationalized rather a pragmatic approach should be taken .
The U.S. State Department said in May 2002 that a computer Hacker had infiltrated its e-mail system .
The Hacker sent a potentially damaging virus to more than 20000 people who receive travel warnings electronically .
A 50 - line code of the love bug virus affects more than 2.8 million files monthly .
Hackers have sent love letter e-mail to all chosen Heads of States from adolfahitler.com .
Pentagon sites had denial of service for more than three hours .
India 's premier nuclear research center Bhabha Atomic resarch center sites were disfigured .
Sadagopan stated that a section of technologists think cyber soldiers , cyber policemen and cyber insurance is needed .
Sadagopan said the threat is overstated and that it is like any other threat , like a foreigner driving on Bangalore roads .
The threat needs to be accepted and then education is the next step .
Sadagopan said it needs to be started today .
It cannot be postponed .

Pakistan authorities announce upgrades of security of nuclear facilities and employees after press reports alleging leaks of its its nuclear technology .
Pakistan on 030122 announced upgrades to the security of nuclear facilities and employees after a series of press reports alleging leaks of nuclear technology to North Korea and possibly Iran and Iraq .
The Los Angeles Times , New York Times and Japanese media have carried several reports quoting unnamed US officials saying that Pakistani scientists or military officers had sold the North Korean government uranium - enrichment technology for the nuclear program .
Pakistan 's government has angrily rejected the reports as malicious and insisted that nuclear technology had never been sold or leaked .
The military statement said Pakistan 's has a long - standing capability for achieving the highest levels of safety and security which is adequate and fail - safe .
The Pakistani government 's announcement came after President Pervez Musharraf chaired a meeting of the Development Control Committee of the National Command Authority ( NCA ) to review security of Pakistan 's nuclear program .
An official military statement said the physical protection and custodial controls at Pakistan 's nuclear sites and facilities has been recently upgraded .
The statement said the NCA gave approval for further tightening of different defensive layers and enhancing physical security as well as ensuring the effectiveness of watertight safety of materials , equipment and technology .
The NCA also adopted steps to improve personal reliability programs for people working in nuclear - related programs .
Scientists , engineers and military officers working in nuclear programs are routinely screened every 2 years according to a survey of Pakistan 's nuclear security by Italy 's arms control institution the Landau network .
2 Pakistani nuclear scientists were arrested 12 months ago and interrogated by US Federal Bureau of Investigation agents on suspicion of possible cooperation with the Taliban .
These arrests underlined fears that nuclear technology could fall into the hands of Islamic extremists .
Pakistan 's government has been developing a nuclear program to match arch - rival India 's since the 1970s and only went public with the program in 980500 when testing 5 nuclear devices .
Jane 's Defence Weekly estimates that Pakistan 's government possesses 25-50 nuclear warheads and has a uranium enrichment plant and plutonium reprocessing plant close to the capital Islamabad and at least 4 nuclear reactors across the country .
Pakistan 's NCA also decided on 030122 not to respond to India 's 3 missile tests this month and stated that Pakistan 's government has no desire to increase tension in the region .

Plutonium enough to produce 25 nuclear bombs which has gone unaccounted for at a Japanese nuclear facility is mostly due to measuring shortcomings and miscalculations .
A nuclear fuel reprocessing plant about 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) north of Tokyo in Tokaimura has extracted 6890 kilograms ( 15158 pounds or 7.6 short tons ) of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel since it began operating in 770000 .
A Japanese education and science ministry official said on 030128 that the total currently accounted for at the facility was 206 kg short of the plutonium initially estimated to have been produced by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from power plants .
It is known to take 5-8 kg of plutonium to produce a nuclear bomb .
The official at the ministry 's nuclear safeguard office said that the case had been reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) of the United Nations .
The finding was also reported to the Japanese government 's Atomic Energy Commission on 030128 .
The education and scienc Ministry denied the possibility that any plutonium had been illegally removed from the facility .
The official said 94 kg of the missing plutonium is presumed to have dissolved into waste water without being measured .
The official added that another 29 kg disintegrated into another type of element .
The official said that plutonium may have been stuck to fuel tubes or mixed with waste water being processed to be solidified in glass and disposed of .
The official also pointed to possible errors in the estimate of plutonium extracted in the process .
The official said that there was a need for improvements in measuring and evaluating methods of plutonium .
The report was based on inspections at the Tokaimura facility done under IAEA safeguard rules designed to prevent the transfer of nuclear materials for production of nuclear weapons .
Tokaimura is a Pacific Coast complex of nuclear - related facilities and made headlines in 990000 when the world 's worst nuclear plant accident since Chernobyl in 860000 occurred at a uranium reprocessing plant there .
3 workers set off a critical reaction in 990000 when they poured too much uranium into a precipitation tank .
2 of the 3 workers later died .
Safety concerns at nuclear facilities in Japan were further highlighted on 030127 when a High Court upheld the suspension of operations of a troubled experimental fast - breeder reactor which has been shut since an accident in 950000 .

Officials stated that on 030128 Italy 's Internet network was hit by most serious Internet attack to date that severely disrupted Italy 's post offices .
The attack on Italy 's Internet network occurred as similiar attacks around the globe appeared to be subsiding .
A computer security expert named Fulvio berghella stated that the 030128 attack on Italy 's Internet network were the result of a digital worm named sq hell and that the attack was the worst Internet attack ever to hit Italy .
Fulvio berghella stated that the digital worm named sq hell was particularly virulent and replicated itself at the rate of 8000 times an hour .
Fulvio berghella heads an Internet security firm named securitynet .
Fulvio berghella stated that the digital worm named sq hell has a very high capacity to replicate itself and the digital worm named sq Hell is slowing down the Poste italiane computer network and making some computers inoperable .
The sq Hell is considered a computer worm .
A computer worm is unlike a computer virus and does not require a user to open an e-mail attachment or initiate any other type of command to infect the computer .
Paolo baldelli stated that online work at Italy 's 14000 post offices was severely disrupted by the Internet attack .
Paolo baldelli stated that the Internet attack overloaded computers with millions of messages .
Paolo baldelli is the official responsible for Poste italiane 's computer system .
Beginning at 0100 Greenwich Mean Time Poste italiane 's computers were overwhelmed with the messages entitled Hi .

Indonesian authorities stated that the Islamic militant group Jemaah Islamiyah is responsible .
The attack is considered part of a global incitement to Jihad by al-Qaeda and its allies .
Advani stated --
The Bali attack established Southeast Asia as a potential new theater for the spread of jihadi extremism .
India previously knew that the operational center of jihadi terrorism is located near India due to the US - lead bombing campaign against extremist bases in Afghanistan .
Advani stated --
The menace of religious extremism has inspired international terrorism .
Terrorism should not be identified with any religion but jihadi terrorism has spread more global violence than any other extremist doctrine .
Advani stated --
Countries must continue in pursuing enhanced cooperation including intelligence sharing and border controls to combat the problem perpetrated by global terrorism and its concomitants -- drug trafficking , illegal arms trade and cross - border crime .
While the international consensus is that terrorism cannot be tolerated , the instruments the international community proposes to deal with terrorism do not meet the requirements of the problem .
Advani stated at a forum organized by the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies --
Countries must formulate and implement an integrated and cooperative approach to security by designing new security systems to protecting transport , communication and energy infrastructure from terrorist attack as well as obstructing terrorists ' funding .
Unilateral military action such as the standoff between the US and Iraq on disarming Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatens peace and could lead to unforeseen negative consequences .
The issue of weapons of mass destruction should be dealt with in the UN .
Rising tensions in the Middle East will affect oil prices .
The the region should provide greater energy security through developing alternative energy technologies .

A team of South African weapons experts departs for Iraq with UN approval to assist with Iraq 's disarmament program .
Political tensions are increasing as the U.S. threatens war against Iraq .
South African President Thabo Mbeki stated on 18 February 2003 that a South African team of weapons experts will depart to Iraq within days to assist with Iraq 's disarmament program .
In an address to parliament in Cape Town Mbeki stated --
A number of distinguished South Africans will travel to Iraq this week .
The weapons experts will be able to address all matters that relate to nuclear , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction , missile systems , non - proliferation and disarmament .
Mbeki stated in his State of the Nation Address on 14 February 2003 that Iraq had accepted an offer from South Africa to send a team of weapons experts to assist Iraqi government officials , scientists and engineers with its disarmament program .
South Africa dismantled a number of nuclear weapons 10 years ago and was recently praised for its model cooperation with weapons experts invited to inspect its sites .
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad stated that South Africa is the only country in the world that has destroyed nuclear weapons .
Pahad stated that the group of South African experts will be able to assist the Iraqis by relating its experience .
The team of seven experts comprises Deon Smit , Ben Steyn , Phillip Coleman , super moloi , Daan van beeck , Peter Goosen and Tom Markram .
The team would visit Iraq in a consulting role and would not replace UN weapons inspectors .
Ben Steyn is a colonel in the South African National Defense Force .
Steyn oversaw the end of the apartheid regime 's chemical and biological warfare program called Project Coast .
Germ warfare expert Wouter Basson directed Project Coast before Steyn .
In 2002 Basson was acquitted in a South African court on all 46 charges filed against him including murder , fraud and drug dealing .
Basson 's trial related to his work as head of Project Coast .
Basson 's trial lasted 30 months .
Smit is a South African parastatal Armscor 's acquisitions general manager .
Coleman is the Managing Director of South Africa 's designated single small - scale facility in terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention .
Van beek is the director of non - proliferation and space in the Trade and Industry Department .
Van beek also heads the secretariat for the Council for the non - proliferation of weapons of mass destruction which oversees South Africa 's non - proliferation legislation .
Mbeki expressed confidence that the South African team of experts would contribute greatly to Iraq 's efforts to meet obligations imposed by the UN Security Council .
The Government of South Africa 's proposal to assist the Iraqi government was discussed with UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan and the UN weapons inspectors in Iraq .
This week the UN Security Council is debating U.S. threats to lead a war on Iraq after chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix delivered a progress report to the body on 14 February 2003 .
South Africa 's ambassador to the United Nations Dumisani Khumalo has been calling for public sessions of the Security Council instead of closed meetings in order to allow other countries to participate in discussions .
South Africa is the chair of both the African Union and Non - Aligned Movement and has been vocal in its opposition to an attack on Iraq .
South Africa states that the UN Security Council is the only body fit to deal with the matter .
In February 2003 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former President Nelson Mandela stated that U.S. President George W. Bush lacked foresight , could not think properly , and would cause a world holocaust if the U.S. continued with plans to wage war against Iraq .
Critics have stated that despite the dire effects an Iraqi conflict would have on the African continent South Africa needed to carefully assess balancing its economic relations with the United States with its serious opposition to a U.S. - led war .
In his speech before parliament 14 February 2003 Mbeki referred to this criticism as most unfortunate stating --
Critics suggest that the South African Government 's behavior with regard to the United States Government should be governed by economic benefits that derive from AGOA ( African Growth and Opportunity Act ) .
The South African government maintains very good relations with the United States Government .
Differences on any issue have never pressured the South African Government into submitting to the United States ' views .

UN nuclear inspectors to depart for Iran to conduct inspections of 2 sites .
On 20 February 2003 Iranian opposition group National Council of Resistance of Iran ( NCRI ) stated that Iran was building banned uranium enrichment sites as part of a nuclear weapons program .
The statement was made on the evening preceding a UN team 's departure for Iran to conduct inspections at 2 nuclear sites .
U.S. Representative for NCRI soona samsami stated at a press conference in Washington D.C. that Iran 's strategy is to build weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons in particular in order to alter the balance of power in the region in its favor and to facilitate export of fundamentalism and terrorism .
UN International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and its director Mohamed ElBaradei depart for Iran 21 February 2003 to conduct an inspection at a site in Natanz where representatives of the NCRI have stated that the regime has concealed a test centrifuge .
NCRI showed satellite photographs of a site in Natanz portraying a cluster of warehouses in which the group claims the regime has hidden centrifuges used to enrich uranium that could be used in nuclear weapons .
Samsami stated that the clerical regime is taking advantage of the current crisis in the region and has accelerated its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons .
On 09 February 2003 Iranian President Mohammed Khatami recognized the existence of a uranium mine and extraction center but promised that the uranium would be used only for peaceful purposes .
The U.S. government was skeptical of Iran 's intentions and stated that Iran 's pursuit of a complete fuel cycle only made sense if it were pursuing nuclear weapons .
NCRI stated on 20 February 2003 that Iran 's clerical rulers are also building and have tested missiles that would eventually have a range of 4000 to 6000 kilometers ( 2500 to 3700 miles ) .
NCRI stated that the information on Iran 's weapons program had been supplied through their intelligence network within Iran and that satellite photographs were supplied by the Institute for Science and International Security .
The Institute for Science and International Security is a non - profit clearinghouse for security information and images .
Samsami stated --
The Iranian government had removed sensitive equipment from the Natanz site in anticipation of the IAEA inspection this weekend .
The Iranian government intended to bar IAEA entry to 1 of the 5 large buildings where the centrifuge is located and would claim that it is a warehouse similar to the other 4 .
Samsami provided street addresses of the suspect facilities .
ElBaradei planned to conduct inspections at the Natanz facility south of Tehran and at the Arak site southwest of Tehran on 22 February 2003 and 23 February 2003 .
NCRI stated that the Arak site produces heavy water for the production of plutonium .
Plutonium is used as a trigger in nuclear weapons .
Samsami stated that such weapons are a matter of survival for the regime in Iran .
Samsami stated that Iran 's clerical regime is in a tenuous position facing unprecedented social disenchantment and expansion of popular resistance and would therefore not hesitate to use weapons of mass destruction to stabilize its position .
The Government of Iran revealed earlier this month that it had discovered uranium deposits near the central city of Yazd and that a uranium oxide plant had been completed in the central city of Isfahan and would be complemented by an enrichment plant now under construction near Kashan to its north .
The plant in Yazd Province would produce concentrated yellow cake uranium while another facility at an undisclosed location would complete the cycle by producing finished fuel made entirely in Iran .

Kashmiri militant groups claim responsibility for attack on Indian police post in the disputed region that killed at least 11 people .
Indian officials claim that foreign infiltrators from Pakistan executed the attack but local Kashmiri groups call this baseless propaganda .
On 16 March 2003 Kashmiri militants claimed responsibility for an attack on a police post in the disputed state of Kashmir in India stating that they attacked to avenge the killing of their commanders by Indian troops .
The Hizbul Mujahideen is the largest group fighting Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan region .
A spokesman for Hizbul Mujahideen who declined to be identified stated to AFP --
The attack was in retaliation to the recent killing of district commander Amanullah and 3 other fighters of Hizbul Mujahideen by the Indian army in Kashmir .
Approximately 10 to 15 fighters from Hizbul Mujahideen , Harkatul Mujahideen , Harkatul Jihad - e - Islami and Al Badar attacked the camp before midnight on 15 March 2003 and into 16 March 2003 and killed at least 12 soldiers .
All the fighters who participated in the operation were local Kashmiris not infiltrators from Pakistan as claimed by Indian officials .
The Indian claim that cross - border incursions have increased is baseless and aimed at covering up its failures in occupied Kashmir .
The militants attacked the post in Gool in the Udhampur district approximately 95 miles north of Indian Kashmir 's winter capital Jammu .
At least 11 people were killed in the attack .
A spokesman for another Kashmiri separatist group called Harkatul Mujahideen agreed with the Hizbul official stating --
The attack was executed by local Kashmiri fighters affiliated with 4 groups .
If India blames foreign militants it is part of its propaganda to mislead the international community .
The Kashmir region is divided between India and Pakistan and is claimed by both .
India and Pakistan have fought 2 wars over Kashmir since each gained independence from Britain in 1947 .
India accuses Pakistan of funding and training rebels fighting to end Indian rule in Kashmir .
Pakistan denies the charge .
Since 1989 more than 37500 people have died in the insurgency in Kashmir .

Kazakhstan increased its air defenses to prevent any missiles fired during the Iraq war from threatening its Caspian coast .
The coast is a home to vital oil industry installation .
On March 21 , 2003 a spokesman for the Central Asian country 's defense ministry said Kazakhstan increased its air defenses to prevent any missiles fired during the Iraq war from threatening its Caspian coast .
The coast is a home to vital oil industry installation .
Defense ministry spokesman abish smailov told AFP that incidents occur when powerful weapons such as Scud missiles are used .
Smailov said that Kazakh air space is controlled at all times using measures involving anti - missile defenses , fighter jets and anti - terrorist units .
Kazakhstan 's increased air defenses come during Kazakhstan 's air force carries out exercises along its Caspian shores .
The shores are a center of Kazakhstan 's nascent oil industry .
Western countries said it is inadequately defended in the event of terrorist attack .
Ex - Soviet Kazakhstan is separated from Iraq by a 600 - kilometer ( 360 - mile ) section of the Caspian Sea and Iranian territory .
Kazakhstan is currently cooperating with the United States on strengthening defenses in this oil - rich area .
Kazakh politicians said that any overthrow of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein could reduce Western interests in exploiting Kazakhstan 's oil fields .
Investors could turn their attention to Iraq 's vast oil resources instead .

The methamphetamine pills known as Yaa BAA have surpassed heroin as Thailand 's number one killer drug .
Several million Thai people use the drug .
The methamphetamine pills known as Yaa BAA have surpassed heroin as Thailand 's number one killer drug .
Several million Thai people use the drug .
The pill has become part of Thai society .
No other drug has become as integral in decades .
The effects on the brains of its consumers is disastrous .
Yaa BAA is known as crazy medicine in Thailand .
It has been targeted in a two - month anti - drugs crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of nearly 1,900 suspected traffickers .
There is much concern over the drug .
The drug 's popularity increased in the mid - 1990s .
It has made Thailand the world 's number one consumer .
Pierre - Arnaud chouvy and Joel meissonnier state in their book Yaa BAA recently published by the Institute of Research on contemporary Southeast Asia that the psychotropic drugs is used across society for both work and pleasure .
Construction workers , sailors , farmers and taxi drivers take the drug to help them through long working days .
Students use it to get through exam periods .
Clubbers use it to help them dance all night .
Yaa BAA possesses several qualities that have helped it supplant heroin as the drug of choice in Thailand .
The book states that the drug conveys a completely positive image .
It appears modern and inoffensive because it is synthetic .
The energy , confidence and euphoric feeling has given users an image as a drug of happiness .
The pills can also be easily consumed .
They can be popped or dissolved in a glass of water , taken intravenously , pulverized and inhaled , or smoked .
There are at least 90 types of the pill .
Yaa BAA is easy to manufacture and do not have any climate uncertainties like other drugs have .
Instructions on how to manufacture the drug are available on the Internet .
Heroin requires opium poppy as its raw ingredient and cocaine depends on yields from the coca plant .
The drug has an affordable price .
It cost 60 baht ( 1.50 dollars ) per pill on the streets before Thailand 's drug war started on February 1 , 2003 and push the price up 300 percent .
The pill costs five - cents to produce .
800 million pills entered Thailand from Myanmar last year .
The book states that the majority of the drug comes from Myanmar particularly the areas controlled by the Wa of the UWSA ( United Wa State Army ) .
The book is referring to the pro - Yangon ethnic group said to operate around 50 laboratories close to the border and the mobile production units .
Myanmar could become an unrivaled regional producer because of the links between the military rulers and the UWSA , and the jungle canopy where UWSA operate .
The military and UWSA links result in a lack of law enforcement .
The drug has become a specialty of the Golden Triangle where Thailand , Laos and Myanmar converge .
Much of the world 's opium is still produced there .
Chouvy and meissonnier say that methamphetamine is overtaking heroin as the production drug of choice in the area and is profiting enormously from the distribution networks that heroin trafficking has already established .
Five percent of Thailand 's population is now estimated to abuse methamphetamine .
The International Narcotics Control Bureau says the figure makes it the largest per capita consumer in the world .
The drug has been around in other forms for years .
It was first used in the 1920s as an antidepressant and then as a psychostimulant during World War II and the Vietnam War .
People recruited from impoverished ethnic minorities transport the pills along a multitude of routes .
Myanmar soldiers and Thai police and bureaucrats protect the cargo and allow them to eventually reach consumers in Thailand .
The books states that one pill will pass through seven intermediaries from the frontier runner to the retailer .
The retailer will usually sell more to the drug user than he or she requires .
This creates another dealer and explains the drug 's easy availability across Thailand .
Owners of boats in the southern coastal province of Ranong and construction foremen in Bangkok are known to force their workers to take the drug at the beginning of the workday .
Occasionally in rural areas the farmers dissolve the drug in a bottle which they drink while working .
Consumers are as young as seven and school has become one of the main hubs for trafficking of methamphetamine .
Thailand 's youth are the most at risk .

Afghanistan 's Interior Minister states that Taliban is not capable of destabilizing the Afghan government despite post - winter increase in attacks on government and foreign targets in the country .
Most of the attacks are carried out by Pakistan - based former Taliban members sent into Afghanistan and funded by drug smuggling operations or supporters in Pakistan .
On 03 April 2003 Afghanistan 's Interior Minister Ali Ahmad Jalali stated that Taliban and remaining al-Qaeda militants are not capable of destabilizing the Afghan government despite their increased attacks on government and foreign targets .
Jalali was speaking at his first press conference since taking office in February 2003 .
Jalali stated that the arrival of spring weather was the reason for the increased number of attacks by Taliban and remaining members of Osama bin Laden 's al-Qaeda network .
The traditional fighting season in Afghanistan is spring after the harsh winters .
Jalali stated that due to the warmer spring weather terrorist activities have increased particularly in the south and southeast regions of Afghanistan .
On 02 April 2003 the U.S. State Department stated that security in Afghanistan was volatile and unpredictable following a series of attacks against foreigners .
In a travel advisory the U.S. State Department stated that travel in all areas of Afghanistan including the capital Kabul is unsafe due to military operations , land mines , banditry , armed rivalry among political and tribal groups , and the possibility of terrorist attacks including attacks using vehicular or other bombs .
Taliban and al-Qaeda militants regularly launch attacks on government and foreign targets .
Last week a foreign Red Cross worker was murdered and 2 U.S. special forces were killed in an ambush while on patrol .
Jalali stated --
On 03 April 2003 Afghan militia forces were fighting Taliban extremists for the 3rd day near Spin Boldak in southern Kandahar province near the Pakistani border .
There are approximately 50-60 terrorists in the mountains of the southern Kandahar province and the Kandahar security forces are conducting operations against them .
On 02 April 2003 2 members of the security forces were killed and 1 was wounded .
7 of the terrorists were arrested .
Several former Taliban members were arrested in another operation in southern Ghazni province .
Jalali stated that among the former Taliban members arrested were several well - known former Taliban figures who were in Afghanistan to establish a network of terrorist organizations and to conduct anti - government activities in the area .
Among those arrested was former Taliban Education Minister Shaheed Kheil .
Jalali stated --
Approximately 15 suspected Taliban members were captured in Kandahar and 9 killed in operations launched after the 27 March 2003 murder of the Red Cross worker .
Most of the terrorist attacks are carried out by former Taliban members based across the border in Pakistan .
These members have confessed that they were sent from Pakistan into Afghanistan by the former Taliban leader .
The Pakistan - based former Taliban members conducting the attacks were being funded by former drug smuggling operations or by supporters in Pakistan .
The militants coming across the border from Pakistan into Afghanistan are organized by former Taliban elements .
Funds are transferred to the Pakistan - based former Taliban members from Karachi , Quetta and Peshawar but this does not indicate that the Government of Pakistan is supporting the former Taliban .
It is true that the interrogated Afghan Taliban stated that they had come from Pakistan and received their financial support from Karachi and Quetta but this does not indicate that the Government of Pakistan is supporting them .
There are many fundamentalists across the world as well as in Pakistan and Afghanistan .

A purported Ayman al-Zawahiri recording called for more suicide attacks , highlighting again the role of Egyptians in al-Qaeda , while suspicions grow that another Egyptian , Seif al-Adel , may have been behind the bombings in Saudi Arabia .
In a message aired 030521 by Arabic Qatar 's Al-Jazeera satellite channel , the purported voice of Ayman al-Zawahiri urged Muslims to force Westerners out of Muslim lands by attacking westerners and emulating the 010911 suicide attacks in the United States .
The speaker called for Muslims to muster their resolve and hit the embassies of America , England , Australia and Norway , and strike at the interests , companies and employees of America , England , Australia and Norway .
The speaker urged Muslims to attack and eject Americans , British , Australians and Norwegians out of Muslim homelands .
The speaker told Muslims not to allow Americans , British , Australians , Norwegians or other Western Christians to live in and benefit from the resources of Muslim countries .
Egyptian experts said this audiotape was a genuine recording of Zawahiri 's voice and proved Zawahiri was alive and still as influential as before in al-Qaeda .
Montasser al-Zayat , a lawyer who has represented Islamic militant suspects in Egypt , stated he was certain that the voice on the tape was that of Zawahiri , Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden 's top lieutenant .
Al-Zayat stated that the recording was Zawahiri 's voice , style and manner .
Dia al-Rashwan stated that he believed that the voice was Zawahiri 's and that the message bore Zawahiri 's characteristic emphasis on Islamic militant attacks against Arab governments which are allied to the United States .
Al-Rashwan is a journalist with Egypt 's government daily Al-Ahram and an expert on Islamic militants .
According to Rashwan , while bin Laden has always stressed international targets , Zawahiri has gradually shown increasing support for Arab targets as well .
Rashwan thought it was clear that Zawahiri is still second in command of al-Qaeda and that his stress on local ( Arab ) targets was influencing not only statements and actions by Al-Qaeda itself but also groups inspired by them .
Montasser al-Zayat said that he believed bin Laden was under secure protection with Zawahiri .
Zayat thought that security conditions sometimes dictate which one speaks out .
The situations and locations of Zawahiri , bin Laden and other top al-Qaeda members have been unknown since the United States struck the bases of al-Qaeda and its Taliban supporters in Afghanistan in 011000 .
Rashwan was unable to illuminate suspicions that Seif al-Adel , another Egyptian , might have masterminded the triple suicide bombings that killed 34 people , including 9 bombers , in Riyadh , Suadi Arabia 030512 .
Rashwan and other Egyptian experts said that Adel has become Al-Qaeda 's number 3 in command since becoming chief of military operations and succeeding Abu Hafs al-Masri .
Al-Masri was killed during the war in Afghanistan .
Adel was a top member in the Egyptian Islamic militant movement Al - Jihad .
Al-Jihad was led by Zawahiri and carried out many attacks in Egypt in the 1990s .
Adel left Egypt at the end of the 1980s for a Gulf Arab country , then traveled to Pakistan and then Afghanistan , where he helped train militants at some camps , Egyptian sources said on condition they not be named .
The Egyptian sources also said that Adel is close to both Zawahiri and bin Laden .
A senior Saudi official said 030519 that he believed Adel directed the bombings in Riyadh .
A senior United States official stated that it was still not clear whether Adel had personally been involved .
Like Zawahiri , Adel and Al-Masri were on a list of 12 most wanted suspects released by the US administration following the 010911 attacks .
At least three other Egyptians were also on the list : Tharwat Salah Shehata , Tariq Anwar As - Sayyid Ahmad and Mohammad Salah .
Egyptian security sources said that Ahmad and Salah were killed in the war on terror launched after 010911 .
Ahmad and Salah were believed to have organized suicide attacks .
Shehata , a laywer , is considered by security sources in Egypt to be responsible for Al-Qaeda 's funding .

Indian troops already fighting rebels in Kashmir are now engaged in a massive campaign to destroy poppy crops in the region .
Troops are facing angry farmers unaware that poppy cultivation is now punishable as a drug trafficking offense .
Indian troops already fighting rebels are now also engaged in a massive operation to destroy poppy crops in Kashmir .
Customs officials from the Federal Finance Ministry launched the campaign with security forces on 15 May 2003 in the southern Kashmir already affected by much violence .
The campaign requires troops to confront angry residents desperate to earn a living and unaware they are violating the law .
Senior Customs Officer V. Prabhakar stated that in 2003 the troops have destroyed opium poppy crops dispersed over 224.73 hectares ( 556 acres ) in 27 villages of Anantnag and Pulwama districts .
A similar drive was carried out in 2002 in the same region but did not stop residents from replanting .
Prabhakar stated --
The crop destruction of 2002 has not served as a deterrent .
The State administration has been lax on the issue .
No district official has ever taken steps to destroy the crop nor even reported that poppy crops are grown in his area .
Villagers in this region approximately 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) south of Kashmir 's summer capital Srinagar stated that cultivating poppy crops was their only livelihood .
Farmer Ghulam Ahmed stated that he and other farmers have been growing poppy crops in their fields for years with no objection from anyone .
Ahmed stated that residents were shocked when officials and troops started destroying their harvest .
Many villagers grow poppy for their seeds used to flavor the Kashmiri bread known as kulcha .
Kulcha is always in great demand across the Himalayan region .
Bakers buy the seeds at 100 rupees ( two U.S. dollars ) per kilogram .
The lucrative byproduct is poppy SAP which can be processed into opium .
Rahti Begum was disconsolate as she watched her crop being destroyed .
Begum who raises the 3 children of her late son stated that her poppy crop is her only source of income .
Some officials admit the residents are not at fault .
A State official told AFP --
These villagers are innocent .
They cultivate the crop for poppy seeds unaware that its cultivation is punishable .
The villagers are inadvertently involving themselves in drug trafficking .
Officials state that because many farmers are unaware of these laws security forces make no arrests over poppy cultivation .
Prabhakar states --
If the cultivation continues unrestrained Kashmir may soon become notorious for narcotics .
This has potential serious consequences as Kashmiri youth may become addicted to narcotics grown in the region .
Poppy cultivation at present is largely organized by groups who use their own trucks to transport the drugs for sale in other parts of India .
In 2002 the Indian army seized 350 kilograms ( 772 pounds ) of narcotics in the Kashmir Valley .
He will intensify the anti - drug operation .
Federal and state officials and non - governmental organizations should cooperate on the anti - drug campaign and could end the poppy trade in Kashmir .
A crucial element of the campaign 's success is education of the public .
The region of Kashmir is already unstable from 14 years of the separatist violence that has killed 10s of 1000s of people and has devastated their once prosperous tourism industry .

A 5 billion United States dollar North Korean nuclear reactor project is contingent upon progress of discussions between North Korea and South Korea regarding North Korea 's desire to obtain nuclear weapons .
Charles Kartman stated on 030630 that the 5 billion United States dollar North Korean nuclear reactor project is contingent upon progress of discussions between North Korea and South Korea regarding North Korea 's desire to obtain nuclear weapons .
Officials stated that Charles Kartman made the statement during talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Yoon Young - kwan .
Charles Kartman is executive director of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization .
Wi Sung - lac stated to reporters that Charles Kartman stated that the North Korean nuclear reactor project is linked to North Korea 's problem with nuclear weapons .
Wi Sung - lac is the head of the South Korean Foreign Ministry 's North American Affairs Bureau .
Wi Sung - lac stated that Charles Kartman stated that North Korea 's participation in the multilateral talks proposed by the United States to settle the nuclear crisis would help Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization resolve any policy differences over the North Korean nuclear reactor project .
Wi Sung - lac stated that Japan seems to have taken a similar position to south Korea and that there seems to be no determined policy despite various opinions in the United States .
Wi Sung - lac refused to give any details about the North Korean nuclear reactor project .
The Yonhap News Agency stated that Charles Kartman would reaffirm that the North Korean nuclear reactor project may not be completed if the North Korean government continued to pursue a nuclear agenda .
The United States Government has reportedly suggested the North Korean nuclear reactor project be halted as part of growing diplomatic pressure on the South Korean government .
South Korea has so far taken a cautious stance on the issue of the North Korean nuclear reactor project .
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization was created under a 940000 Agreed Framework between North Korea and the United States .
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization was to provide North Korea with 2 light - water nuclear reactors deemed unsuitable for weapons production and 500000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil per year .
Construction on the 2 light - water nuclear reactors started in 020800 and is already behind schedule .
Construction on 1 of the 2 light - water nuclear reactors was originally planned to be completed in 030000 .
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization has maintained construction work on the 2 light - water nuclear reactors and has suspended shipments of fuel oil to North Korea from 021200 at the height of the nuclear stand - off which intensified in 021000 when the North Korean government admitted to running a nuclear weapons program based on enriched uranium .
The 940000 Agreed Framework between North Korea and the United States required North Korea to stop the use of graphite - moderate reactors used to produce weapons - grade plutonium at North Korea 's Yongbyon nuclear plant .

The Chinese government 's recent conclusion that North Korea has enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb has resulted in urgent diplomacy and plans for new talks .
Chinese deputy foreign minister was dispatched to North Korea to meet with Kim Jong - Il in an attempt to deescalate the situation .
Chinese diplomats were quoted in the Asian Wall Street Journal on 18 July 2003 as stating that China believes North Korea currently has enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb .
This belief caused the Government of China to accelerate diplomacy to resolve the crisis and to dispatch Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo to Pyongyang , North Korea on 12 July 2003 in this effort .
China is North Korea 's closest ally .
North Korea is a Stalinist regime .
Dai is presently in Washington D.C. to inform top U.S. policymakers of the outcome of the rare meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong - Il .
The newspaper stated that in recent weeks Chinese intelligence services concluded that North Korea is producing weapons - grade plutonium in sufficient quantities and possesses all the necessary components to assemble nuclear - tipped missiles .
A European official familiar with internal Chinese reports on the findings and Chinese diplomats were quoted in the newspaper as stating that the reprocessed plutonium is estimated to be sufficient to make at least 1 nuclear device .
The European official stated that North Korea has yet to combine the plutonium , triggering devices and other components into a bomb .
The Chinese reports in part verify recent claims made by the Government of North Korea that a number of spent nuclear fuel rods sealed in 1994 have been opened and have undergone reprocessing ostensibly to produce plutonium .
Until now China had stated that no evidence existed that North Korea was seeking nuclear weapons .
The U.S. government has been unable to confirm the North Korean government 's claims .
U.S. and South Korean officials have speculated that North Korea may have 1 or 2 nuclear bombs and may have the capacity to build 6 .
The Chinese government 's increasing concern was made evident by the new urgency of its diplomacy this week .
At a foreign ministry briefing on 17 July 2003 spokesman Kong Quan stated that the North Korean crisis was at a critical point .
Kong Quan stated that China is attempting to deescalate the situation by promoting talks and encouraging the 2 parties to make peace .
Kong Quan stated that it is important that the parties return to negotiations and continue with the trilateral talks that commenced in April 2003 .
The trilateral talks of April ended poorly with the North Korean government stating it possessed and might test nuclear weapons .
According to U.S. officials there is now a greater possibility that new talks could occur as North Korea appears willing to join another negotiating session with China and the United States .
There were also indications that the dialogue could be expanded to include Japan and South Korea .
South Korean officials have been quoted as saying that a dialogue could take place as early as August 2003 .
The United States government has always insisted on multilateral talks and has been eager to include its Japanese and South Korean allies .
North Korea has consistently demanded 1 - on - 1 talks with the U.S. government .
The Government of China emphasizes that it is more important to resume talks quickly than to refrain until the number of participants can be agreed upon .
China is a traditional ally and supplier of food and fuel to North Korea China and is therefore the country with the most leverage over North Korea .
China has demonstrated that it is willing to take advantage of this leverage .
Earlier in the crisis China stopped oil supplies to North Korea for several days .
2 days after North Korean leader Kim Jong - Il granted Dai the rare meeting for 14 July 2003 the regime 's Korean Central News Agency announced that China had recently decided to donate 10000 tons of diesel oil to North Korea .

Thailand will host ministers from China , Laos , India and Myanmar to discuss the elimination of precursor chemicals used in drug production .
Officials report that ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will hold talks this week in the northern Thai town of Chiang Rai aimed at eliminating precursor chemicals used in drug production .
The meeting will take place from 22 July 2003 - 25 July 2003 in one of the corners of the Golden Triangle and is the first of its kind .
The meeting will be attended by the ministers responsible for drug suppression in China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand .
Thai Justice Minister pongthep Thepkanjana will host the meeting .
Deputy chief of Thailand 's office of Narcotics Control Board ( ONCB ) rasanee Vistaveth stated the ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand are expected to adopt the Chiang Rai Declaration which will touch on the countries ' commitment to solving the problem of drugs , particularly with regard to precursors and chemical trafficking .
Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are contained in legal medicines and are used to produce illegal stimulants including speed or ice which are produced in large quantities in Myanmar and then trafficked to Thailand and China and beyond .
Chemical precursors are also used to turn raw opium into heroin .
Rasanee stated the ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand expect to openly discuss their countries ' weak points and the measures each country is taking to control these substances and prevent the substances from reaching the Golden Triangle area .
Rasanee said the governments of China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will explore ways to cooperate to intercept the illegal substances which are also used in legitimate industries .
Rasanee stated every country has its own way of controlling precursors but as matter of fact many precursors still flood the Golden Triangle area .
The ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will also address crop substitution initiatives for impoverished ethnic minorities who still rely on opium cultivation .
Rasanee referred to Thailand 's successful decades - long campaign to eliminate poppy growing from its territory and reported that Thailand is willing to help and share its own expertise on opium elimination by training officials .
The ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will discuss how to find markets for goods produced under crop substitution and other related programs such as eco - tourism and handicraft manufacturing .

La times probe finds strong evidence that Iran appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb .
The Los Angeles Times in the 030804 edition Summarized results of an independent probe which strongly indicated that Iran is striving to become the world 's next nuclear power and appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb .
The Los Angeles Times said the 3 - month investigation drew on previously secret reports , international officials , independent experts , Iranian exiles and intelligence sources and uncovered strong evidence that Iran 's commercial program masked a military undertaking .
The Times report said that scientists from Russia , China , North Korea and Pakistan plus advancing technology have propelled Iran 's nuclear program much closer to producing a bomb than Iraq ever was .
The Times pointed out that some experts predict Iran might produce an initial atomic weapon in the next 2-3 years .
No one is certain about the actual time frame for Iran 's nuclear weapon production .
Nuclear materials :
The Times said a confidential report prepared by the French Government in 030500 concluded that Iran is surprisingly close to having enriched uranium or plutonium for a bomb .
A foreign intelligence service provided a copy of the report to the times .
The French government warned other governments in the report to exercise the most serious vigilance on their exports to Iran and Iranian front companies .
The Times report said that samples of uranium taken by UN inspectors in Iran in 030600 tested positive for enrichment levels high enough to be consistent with an attempt to build a nuclear weapon .
The Iranian government also secretly imported 1.8 tons of nuclear material from China in 910000 and processed some of this nuclear material in order to manufacture uranium metal .
This uranium would be of no use in Iran 's commercial program but would be integral to weapons production .
foreign scientists ' involvement :
The Times quoted an unnamed Middle Eastern intelligence official that Pakistan 's role was bigger than thought from the beginning .
Abdul Qadeer Khan has helped Iran for years and is a Pakistani nuclear scientist regarded by the United States as a purveyor of nuclear secrets .
The Times said people inside Iran and foreign intelligence officials say that North Korean military scientists had been recently monitored entering Iranian nuclear facilities and are assisting in the design of a nuclear warhead .
There is a resort on the Caspian coast set aside for the exclusive use of North Koreans who are working on nuclear and missile projects in Iran .
This indicates the number of North Koreans working in Iran on such projects .
Russian scientists sometimes travel to Iran under false identities and work without the Russian government 's approval to help complete a special reactor that could produce weapons - grade plutonium .
New technology :
The report said Iranians have also approached European companies in recent months to buy devices that can manipulate large volumes of radioactive material .
This technology is for forging uranium metal and plutonium and switches that could trigger a nuclear weapon .
European intelligence sources said list of items the Iranians have wished to procure was a strong indication that Iran has moved to the late stages of weapons development .

Iran pledges to provide nuclear information to IAEA and sign nuclear protocol before 20040200 but not to indefinitely suspend uranium enrichment
20031129 Secretary of Iran 's Supreme National Security Council and senior Iranian nuclear official Hassan Rowhani stated --
By 20040200 when director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency of the UN Mohammed El-Baradei presents a new report Iran will provide all required information and means of verification to the IAEA .
The Iranian government will soon authorize its representative to the IAEA to sign the additional protocol to the Non - Proliferation Treaty .
20031126 the IAEA passed a resolution condemning Iran for 18 years of covert nuclear activities .
The resolution contained a passage warning that any further non - proliferation breaches by Iran would occasion stern action .
The US demanded that the Iranian government be brought before the UN Security Council for possible sanctions while Britain , France and Germany demanded that Iran be rewarded for cooperating with the IAEA since 20031000 but neither demand was met by the resolution .
Prior to 20031129 Rowhani had made no statement after the 20031126 IAEA resolution .
Rowhani stated --
The suspension of uranium enrichment is provisional and voluntary and intended to build confidence .
Iran continues to refuse to indefinitely suspend its uranium enrichment activities and reserves the right to recommence enrichment at any moment .
Iran 's uranium enrichment has prompted international concern that Iran may be capable of constructing an atomic bomb .
Iran stated that the purpose its nuclear activities is peaceful .
Rowhani stated that Iran wants to use enriched uranium to supply fuel for a future civil center .
Rowhani stated that the Iranian government will discuss with European governments the transfer of modern technology , nuclear technology and fuel to Iran .
An unprecedented mission by the foreign ministers of Britain , France and Germany in 20031000 convinced the Iranian government to --
Declare the entirety of the country 's nuclear activities .
Suspend uranium enrichment .
Sign the NPT additional protocol allowing stricter inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities .

German technology group Siemens stated that negotiations had begun between Siemens and China to export an unused plutonium - processing facility to China .
On 031202 a German technology group named Siemens stated that delicate negotiations had begun between Siemens and China to export an unused plutonium - processing facility to China and that the negotiations had support from Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder .
Gerhard Schroeder is currently visiting China .
News of the potential sale of the plutonium - processing facility came after Gerhard Schroeder met on 031201 with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao .
German government sources stated that Wen Jiabao expressed interest in the plutonium - processing facility during the 031201 meeting with Gerhard Schroeder and that Gerhard Schroeder then promised to study Wen Jiabao 's request to purchase the plutonium - processing facility .
Gerhard Schroeder is on day 2 of a 3 day visit to China .
Gerhard Schroeder has visited China 5 times since 990000 and has focused the visits on boosting economic relations .
Gerhard Schroeder is accompanied by a strong business delegation including Siemens boss Heinrich von Pierer .
Any sale of plutonium - processing facility between China and Siemens is likely to be highly politically contentious and would need the approval of Gerhard Schroeder 's centre - left ruling coalition .
Gerhard Schroeder 's centre - left ruling coalition includes the environmentalist Greens .
A previous proposal to export the plutonium - processing facility to Russia collapsed in 010000 amid political concerns .
The political concerns were voiced by the Greens and others .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated that Heinrich von Pierer stated that Siemens was beginning talks with interested Chinese parties about a sale of the plutonium - processing facility .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated that Heinrich von Pierer stated that Gerhard Schroeder stated that Gerhard Schroeder is not against the sale of the plutonium - processing facility in principle .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated to the Agence France - Presse that Siemens was confident about the outcome of the talks to sell the plutonium - processing facility .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany refrained from commenting on the political aspect of the sale of the plutonium - processing facility .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated that export permission would be needed from the German Government and that the speed of any sale of the plutonium - processing facility would be contingent upon obtaining the correct political support .
A Chinese delegation has already inspected the plutonium - processing facility at Hanau in western Germany and Siemens has lodged an application for an export licence .
A spokeswoman for Germany 's Federal exports office confirmed Siemens 's application for an export licence had been lodged with Germany 's Federal exports office .
A spokeswoman for Germany 's Federal exports office stated to Agence France - Presse that the application for an export licence was being studied at ministerial level due to the political considerations involved .
The political aspect of the sale of the plutonium - processing facility will be difficult to negotiate .
The plutonium - processing facility is described as Europe 's largest plutonium plant producing fuel for nuclear reactors and was completed in 910000 at a cost of 700 million euros .
The plutonium - processing facility never went into operation and was abandoned in 950000 .
The Hanau plutonium - processing facility was abandoned after safety concerns .
Siemens stated that the Hanau plutonium - processing facility was also abandoned due to political difficulties at a time of growing debate about the future of nuclear power .
The Environment Minister of Hesse state was the Greens member Joschka Fischer who is now Germany 's Foreign Minister .
Hesse state includes Hanau where the plutonium - processing facility is located .
The plutonium - processing facility is estimated to be worth about 50 million euros on 031202 .
Siemens would not comment on the plutonium - processing facility 's estimated value of 50 million euros .
The environmental group Greenpeace urged the German Government to refuse the sale of the plutonium - processing facility .
Greenpeace stated that any sale of the plutonium - processing facility would effectively mark a German contribution to political destabilisation in the Far East .
Greenpeace stated that the fuel of the plutonium - processing facility could be refined to extract weapons - grade material and that the plutonium - processing facility should be scrapped .

A Chinese company has discussed buying a plutonium factory from a German technology group .
German Defence Minister Peter Struck stated that Germany will export a plutonium facility to China only if China guarantees to use it only for peaceful purposes .
4 December 2003 German Defense Minister Peter Struck stated that Germany will export a plutonium facility to China only if China guarantees to use it only for peaceful purposes .
The export is controversial .
Struck spoke in an interview to the Neue Presse daily .
The ruling centre - left coalition has criticized the proposed sale of the plutonium facility .
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder stated earlier this week he will investigate China 's request to buy the plutonium facility .
Schroeder recently visited China .
Struck stated --
Schroeder is correct to promise to examine the proposed exportation .
China must guarantee that the plutonium factory will not be used for military purposes but to produce atomic energy .
The sale is a highly emotional subject .
Struck is confident the coalition will settle its disagreements .
If China makes the guarantee struck will not be concerned about the sale of the facility .
Earlier on 4 December 2003 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao stated --
A Chinese company discussed a possible sale of the facility with owner German technology group Siemens .
The facility would be used for civil purposes and has no military goal .
The facility would have nothing to do with non - proliferation issues .
The facility was completed in 1991 .
The facility would have been Europe 's largest plant producing fuel for atomic power stations .
The facility never went into operation .
In 1995 the facility was abandoned under pressure from environmentalist party the Greens .
The Greens party is now junior partner in Schroeder 's coalition .
Senior green members such as co - leader Angelika Beer demand the sale to China be refused .
Germany is phasing out atomic energy for environmental reasons and senior green members state that it would be hypocritical of Germany to export an atomic energy facility .
According to press reports Greens Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has agreed to a sale .
Some members of of Schroeder 's Social Democrat Party protest the sale .
Schroeder has publicly expressed his support of the sale .
The plutonium facility is located in Hanau , western Germany .
Joschka Fischer is the Greens ' most charismatic figure .

Sources close to the investigation said on 031216 that al-Qaeda officer Mohammed Hamdi al-Ahdal has revealed under interrogation that unnamed Saudis and Yemenis were involved in funding two terrorist attacks in Yemen .
Saudi - born adhal 's alias is Abu Issam al-Maki and was al-Qaeda 's leader in Yemen .
Ahdal was arrested 031100 .
Ahdal revealed that the financing of the attacks against the USS Cole in 001000 and the French supertanker Limburg in 021000 October and other terrorist attacks went through Ahdal and originated from Saudis and Yemenis residing outside .
Ahdal told investigators the money came in installments and in small quantities in order to avoid detection .
Ahdal told the investigators all the financial and technical preparations for the attacks of both the USS Cole and Limburg were supervised by Ahdal and revealed that one of the two suicide bombers in the USS Cole attack carried the family name of Al - thore .
The Saudi - owned Al-majala weekly magazine 's current edition said that Saudis and Yemenis were implicated in the terrorist attacks in Yemen .
Al-majala said the Government of Yemen informed Saudi authorities of information revealed by Ahdal under investigation reagrding Saudi persons involved in the funding and that Yemeni authorities are preparing to receive Saudi officers in joining the investigation .
Al-majala said Yemeni authorities refused a Saudi request asking for Ahdal to be extradited for interrogation in Saudi Arabia because the Yemeni Constitution disallows the handing over of Yemeni citizens regardless of any charges .
A Saudi team of investigators is currently in Yemen .
Yemeni authorities believe Ahdal is the second - in - command to Ali Qaed Sunian al-Harithi .
Ali Qaed Sunian al-Harithi 's alias was Abu Ali al-Harithi .
Harithi was among the six al-Qaeda suspects killed in November 021100 in a missile attack by the US Central Intelligence Agency in the desert region of Al-Naqaa east of Sanaa in Marib province .

Live poultry smuggling undermines WHO and FAO efforts to restrict bird flu spread in Asia .
FAO and WHO advise countries to tighten border security .
Smugglers are undermining international efforts headed by the UN World Health Organization ( WHO ) and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) to eradicate bird flu by trafficking illegal live poultry that threaten to spread the disease to new areas .
Attempts to halt bird flu spread --
Agriculture and customs officials have increased border checks throughout the affected region to halt illicit trade .
Recent arrests of live poultry smugglers have occurred at checkpoints .
Most affected Asian countries have banned the import and export of live and slaughtered poultry to prevent the movement of potentially infected chickens and ducks across borders .
Senior FAO Animal Production and Health Officer in Asia Hans Wagner stated --
The FAO is concerned and well aware that there is copious uncontrolled movement of animals between borders in some Asian countries .
Smuggling occurs chiefly across the Green or uncontrolled borders of Vietnam , Laos , Thailand , Cambodia , Myanmar and China is likely a source for spreading the flu and other diseases .
Authorities in Vietnam stated that smuggling of meat and fruit from China has increased drastically in the past year .
Vietnam has experienced 9 flu fatalities and is the country worst affected by the disease .
Preventing smuggling from Vietnam is difficult because the country 's extensive land borders with China , Laos and Cambodia are poorly controlled by a notoriously corrupt customs department .
Most nations have tightened border controls in accordance with FAO and WHO advisories .
20040120 Cambodian authorities detained 10 in the southern province of Ta KEO for importing over 150000 duck eggs from Vietnam .
Cambodia has continuously been combating chicken and egg smuggling from Vietnam and is on high alert .
20040202 Taiwan tightened security against smugglers following the discovery in 20031200 of H 5N1 in ducks smuggled from mainland China .
Taiwan has previously successfully controlled an outbreak of the milder H 5N2 flu strain .
Taiwanese coastguards increased patrols around the island and several island groups off the Chinese mainland .
Approximately 8000 poultry and pig farmers were vaccinated against human flu to prevent it mutating with bird flu strains .

Volkswagen AG rejects a Chinese newspaper report that it had put a stop to technology transfers of its Santana sedans to joint venture partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp ( SAIC ) .
The China Business Post reported 040209 that German auto giant Volkswagen AG had decided against the further transfer of a technical platform for the Santana sedan model to joint venture partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp ( SAIC ) .
Discontinuing these technology transfers would cause several millions of yuan 's of losses to SAIC .
The China Business Post said SAIC had invested large sums in the scheduled acquisition of the Platform , including acquiring an auto manufacturing plant in Yizheng city in eastern Jiangsu province .
The reported plan was for SAIC to produce a new sedan model designed on the Santana platform and with the car set to be launched in 040500 .
The China Business Post said the termination was due in part to Volkswagen 's adjustment of strategies regarding China and to ineffective communication with Volkswagen 's Chinese partners .
Volkswagen on 040209 rejected this China Business Post report that Volkswagen had put a stop to technology transfers of Santana sedans to SAIC .
Volkswagen group China spokeswoman Melanie Behrens said that the statements made in the China Business Post about the stop of knowledge transfer from VW to SAIC are not true .
Behrens said that Volkswagen does not know where these claims came from and is still working on the subject and trying to clarify the situation .
SAIC was not immediately available for comment .
SAIC also has a joint venture with US - based General Motors .
Analysts said this issue highlights what might be an increasing problem for foreign auto makers as China 's government increases support of domestic car companies in hopes of building stand - alone name brands .
Many Chinese car - makers with overseas venture partners have begun researching and developing cars independently .
Volkswagen is China 's number one passenger car - maker and has two joint ventures in China , Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Company and Faw ( First Automotive Works ) Volkswagen Automotive Company .
Approximately 633000 of Volkswagen 's own cars were sold in China in 030000 , up from 510000 in 020000 .
SAIC sold a total of 800000 sedans in 030000 .
SAIC 's sedan sales topped other domestic auto makers , most of which are volkswagens and General Motors ' buicks .

A draft report prepared for the EU executive stated that the European Union should massively increase research on security issues in order to better protect civilians from terrorist attacks .
The report is created by a working group including Research Commissioner Philippe Busquin and enterprise Commissioner Erkki Liikanen .
It recommends that up to two billion euros be spent per year on a vast pan - European research program .
The European Security Research Program ( ESRP ) would receive EU funding beginning in 2007 .
It is the most ambitious of several recommendations the group is likely to issue when it presents its final conclusions in two or three weeks .
The draft report recommends starting security research funding with one billion euros per year in 2007 .
It will then slowly increase the annual budget to two billion euros .
European spending currently lags behind the United States .
The United States ' Homeland Security Department receives one billion dollars annually plus research credit from the Defense Department .
The report stated that there is no reason why European Security Research should not be funded at a level similar to the United States .
The European Commission strategy allows for a preliminary period of studies and pilot projects from 2004 to 2006 .
It promotes EU - wide synergies in research on top safety issues including protection against bio - terrorism and improved networking between civilian and military authorities across the continent .
65 million euros have been earmarked for the 2004-2006 phase of the research program according to an exploratory Plan of Action presented by the Commission on February 3 , 2004 .
The Working Group on security research was formed last October and includes EU parliamentarians and experts from related industries in addition to the two commissioners .

French anti - terrorist judge calls terrorism serious threat despite dispersal and weakening of al-Qaeda .
Restraining extremist groups is becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed .
France 's top anti - terrorist judge Jean - Louis Bruguiere stated to AFP 29 February 2004 that al-Qaeda is still capable of inspiring people to carry out attacks despite being much weaker since the 11 September 2001 attacks and the U.S. - led war in Afghanistan .
Bruguiere has led the French legal effort against extremism and terrorism in recent years .
Bruguiere stated --
The global fight against terrorism is against an increasingly elusive enemy with access to funds virtually impossible to control .
The threat comes from long - standing members of al-Qaeda .
Al-Qaeda is an organization which still exists but has been significantly weakened by the neutralization and capture of a number of its members and of those in charge .
In an interview in Monaco Bruguiere called global terrorism a scattered and polymorphous threat .
Bruguiere was in Monaco attending a meeting of the international organization involved in Mediterranean political studies called club of Monaco .
Dozens of alleged members of al-Qaeda have been captured or killed since the group claimed responsibility for the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington D.C. but authorities have not been able to locate al-Qaeda 's leader Osama bin Laden or his top deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri .
On 24 February 2004 Zawahiri appeared in 2 taped messages broadcast by the Arab - language Al-Arabiya and Al-Jazeera television stations calling in remarks attributed to him for renewed attacks on the United States .
Bruguiere stated --
Restraining extremist groups particularly across Europe was becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed .
The networks operating in Europe benefit from micro - financing and not from macro - financing .
Fraudulent charge cards could be used to withdraw significant sums which are then distributed through micro - channels outside the classic financial circles and are practically impossible to detect .
Use of false credit cards is growing .
It is necessary to expand existing laws to combat the funding mechanisms .
All existing legal or institutional measures are insufficient to neutralize this threat .
Al-Qaeda is only 1 of many worldwide threats among the many radical Islamic organizations involved in an international jihad and sharing the al-Qaeda strategy that are pursuing regional options .
The groups are particularly active in Africa , Asia and Europe .
Bruguiere made these comments before going into a meeting with approximately 40 high - ranking or former top international officials .
Since the September 2001 strikes on the United States deadly large - scale attacks have occurred in other parts of the world .
Among the targets have been a synagogue in northern Tunisia , a nightclub in Bali , a hotel in Kenya and numerous locations in Chechnya and Russia .
Analysts have warned that Iraq could become a breeding ground for terrorist organizations if a political solution is not found soon .
The United States and Britain invaded Iraq nearly a year ago despite massive international opposition .

Amnesty International urges Laos to treat surrendered ethnic Hmong rebels humanely while Lao officials claim there are no rebels and no insurgency .
The rights group states that Lao troops promised rebels amnesty and a living area if they surrender but has received conflicting reports as to whether the Lao Government has upheld this agreement .
On 05 March 2004 Amnesty International called on the Lao Government to ensure that 100s of ethnic Hmong anti - government insurgents and their families who had reportedly surrendered were treated humanely .
From its London headquarters Amnesty International issued a statement saying that the Lao People 's Democratic Republic has international obligations in this regard under the Geneva Conventions and the 2 UN covenants .
On 03 March 2004 the U.S. government - funded network Radio Free Asia reported --
Up to 700 insurgents and their relatives and 8 rebel commanders surrendered after government troops surrounded several northern holdouts in late February 2004 .
Troops used leaflets and megaphones to help communicate to the rebels that authorities would grant them amnesty and a special living area if they surrendered .
Approximately 300 people surrendered near Luang Prabang after traveling on foot from farther north and between 300 and 400 people surrendered in Xieng Khouang province .
Amnesty International stated it had received conflicting reports as to their reception and treatment by the authorities .
Lao Foreign Ministry Spokesman Yong Chanthalangsy denied that anyone had surrendered insisting also that there were no rebels in the impoverished communist nation .
Yong Chanthalangsy told AFP that no one surrendered , that there are no rebels and there is no war in Laos .
Yong Chanthalangsy stated that there are many people coming out of the forests to take advantage of Lao poverty eradication programs .
Following a series of deadly highway ambushes and bomb blasts the Lao Government called in August 2003 on Hmong and others whom they called ethnic minority bandits to lay down their arms , to come out from the forest and to rejoin society .
The Lao Government warned that failure to do so would result in heavy consequences .
Small bands of ethnic minority rebels predominantly Hmong remain from the CIA - sponsored guerrilla army mobilized to wage the United States ' secret campaign in Laos during the Vietnam War .
Some 300000 Hmong fled to Thailand after the Communist takeover in Laos in 1975 but the remaining rebels have continued a low - level , ineffective insurgency for nearly three decades .
The Lao military has been accused by human rights groups of using harsh and often brutal tactics to eliminate them .
Amnesty International called on the Lao Government to provide UN agencies and other non - governmental organizations access to all those who have put down their arms in order to assist with basic humanitarian needs .
Amnesty International stated --
Longer term assistance with their reintegration into Lao society will also be needed .
It is essential that neutral observers are given access to these groups of former rebels in order to independently assess their situation and the veracity of ongoing claims of serious human rights violations being made by overseas ethnic Hmong groups .
The Lao Government should seize this opportunity to find a peaceful solution to decades of fighting and the high human cost on all sides of the conflict .
In January 2004 , U.S. - based Lao exiles warned that Lao forces had launched a new offensive against 1000s of Hmong rebels and civilians and accused the communist regime of using starvation as a weapon of war .

Desiring admission into the European Union , Albanian government increased efforts against drug trafficking by strengthening laws , seizing illegal drugs , and investigating possibly corrupt police officials .
Under the pressure of the European Union the Albanian Government has escalated its fight against drug trafficking by preparing a new strategy to halt the smuggling of hashish and heroin over Albanian territory from Asia towards the West .
A recent EU report on Albania stated the situation in Albania , which has remained an important country for the traffic of narcotics , is worrisome .
The report suggested the Tirana government adopt an efficient strategy in the Government 's efforts against drug trafficking .
Albanian interior minister Igli Toska stated --
The fight against drug trafficking will be the Albanian government 's main challenge in 2004 .
The Albanian Government has been working on a project of national strategy which will require international support and cooperation .
Albania 's geographic position , Albania 's trade with Turkey and Greece , and the situation after the Kosovo war are all elements Albanian criminal groups profit from , thereby making Albania an important stop for the transit of narcotics .
In July 2004 the Albanian government plans to present a set of anti - Mafia laws which will allow confiscation of property belonging to persons involved in criminal and illegal activities .
Albanian justice minister Adrian dvorani stated the anti - Mafia laws also provide for the special protection of witnesses or people involved in illegal trafficking who decide to testify and will enable a more efficient strategy .
Albanian officials aspire to EU membership .
The Albanian government has made a significant development in the government 's fight against drug smugglers in 2004 .
In 2003 Albanian police infiltrated an international drug network operating between Kosovo , Macedonia , Albania and Italy and controlled by the Kosovo Albanian and Turkish criminal groups linked with the Calabrian Mafia organization N'Drangheta .
In May 2004 approximately 100 policemen -- 25 of them in top positions -- were dismissed on suspected ties with organized crime .
60 others have been investigated on similar charges .
Toska stated there will be no smugglers without corrupted policemen and Toska announced tougher measures against policemen and security officials linked with criminal groups .
The EU report quotes the names of several Albanian politicians directly or indirectly involved in drugs trafficking but no measures have so far been taken against the politicians .
Albanian police forces have seized more than 200 kilos ( 440 pounds ) of heroin and around 8 tons of cannabis between November 2003 and May 2004 , double that which was seized in 2003 .
Experts say the figures of drugs seized are insignificant compared to the estimated quantities of narcotics that are smuggled through Albania .
International Police experts based in Tirana estimate the value of the narcotics in transit at over 2 billion dollars ( about 1.6 billion euros ) per year .
Experts estimate the amount smuggled through Albania makes up approximately 25 to 30 percent of the narcotics smuggled into the European market from the Balkans .
Albanian police official Xhavit Shala stated Albanian smugglers are linked to the international criminal organizations like ( the Italian ) sacra Corona UNITA , Cosa Nostra , the Turkish , Russian , Macedonian and Kosovar mafia , and the Colombian drug cartels .
Bujar Mema of the Albanian Interpol Office stated that drug smugglers have reappeared due to increasing consumption of narcotics in Europe and the production of opium from Afghanistan , which has reached the level of the years before the US intervention in 2001 with 3600 tons produced in 2003 .

Khin yii stated that 14.45 billion dollars worth of drugs have been destroyed since the drug destroying events began in 1990 .
Khin yii stated that opium production and poppy cultivation has declined since 1990 but that methamphetamines are replacing opium as the main choice of traffickers .
Khin yii stated that stimulant tablets are becoming a threat but did not elaborate on the extent of methamphetamine production or trafficking .
The United Nations stated that opium production has declined by 24 percent in Myanmar since 2003 .
In March 2004 the United States stated that while Myanmar had reduced poppy cultivation Myanmar remained the world 's 2nd ranked supplier of opium from which derivatives such as heroin are made .

At one point more than 30000 visits to the Yasukuni Shrine website were made at the same time .
The homepage of the website of Yasukuni Shrine was not damaged by the hacking attempts .
No official was immediately available from Yasukuni Shrine to confirm the reports .
Yasukuni Shrine and Japanese government offices may have come under cyber attack from Chinese hackers in the run - up to the Asian Cup football final between Japan and China in Beijing on August 7 , 2004 .

The companies have exchanged information and established a long - term strategic alliance to share technology .
Taiwan 's Promos Technologies Inc. dismissed reports 04 November 2004 that its technology transfer agreement with South Korea 's Hynix Semiconductor Inc. might falter due to concern from the Government of South Korea .
A promos official stated to AFP --
Reports that the South Korean government is concerned that Hynix would be helping foreign competitors by establishing a partnership with promos are not true .
The pending agreement is unaffected .
Promos will adopt Hynix 's 90 nanometer technology at its new plant in central Taiwan starting in fourth quarter 2005 .
Both makers of dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) chips have exchanged information on Hynix 's 90 and 70 nanometer technologies .
The company Promos stated that it has passed on to Hynix its expertise in 12 - inch ( 300 millimeter ) production .
The 2 DRAM makers signed a memorandum of understanding ( MOU ) in 2003 to initiate a long - term strategic alliance in technology licensing , foundry services and development of new generation memory production processes .

Cyber attacks target Japanese Foreign Ministry homepage .
A Japanese official blames South Korean hackers for the attacks , citing the passage of a Japanese resolution that stressed the Japanese government 's claim to an island chain controlled by South Korea .
A massive amount of information flooded the homepage of the Japanese Foreign Ministry , www.mofa.go.jp , beginning at 9:50 am ( 0050 GMT ) on 17 March 2005 .
Access to the website has been erratic .
Japanese foreign press secretary Hatsuhisa Takashima termed the flood of information a cyber attack and stated that officials are working to fix the problem .
Kyodo News cited a Japanese government source and stated the latest attack may have come from South Korea .
On 16 March 2005 a Japanese local assembly passed a resolution stressing the Japanese government 's claim to a small island chain controlled by South Korea .
Anti - Japanese protests occurred in Seoul after the passage of the resolution .
Japanese government websites have come under occasional cyber attacks especially from countries which Japan invaded in the first half of the 20th century .
In January 2005 , administrators of the Yasukuni Shrine dedicated to Japan 's war dead stated the Yasukuni Shrine 's website had been the target of Internet attacks .
Most of these attacks were via e-mails written in Chinese .
In 2000 , hackers accessed Japanese government websites and left messages in Chinese and English ranging from insults to attacks on Japan 's wartime past , after Japanese conservative groups held a forum in the western city of Osaka to deny the 1937 massacre in the Chinese city of Nanjing by Japanese troops .

Taiwan 's chip company United Microelectronics Corp ( UMC ) announced on March 21 , 2005 that it would obtain a 15 percent stake in China - based chipmaker hejian technology through a compensation package .
Taiwan 's chip company United Microelectronics Corp ( UMC ) announced on March 21 , 2005 that it would obtain a 15 percent stake in China - based chipmaker hejian technology through a compensation package .
The stake was valued at 3.5 billion Taiwan dollars ( 110 million US dollars ) and the investment goes to the core of cross - Straits investment ties .
Both companies are being investigated in Taiwan for alleged breach of trust .
UMC Chairman Robert Tsao said the company had submitted a letter to Taiwan 's Investment Commission asking for assistance in transferring the stake .
It said it was compensation for previous assistance .
UMC manufactures cutting - edge microchips .
The chips are installed in a wide range of computers and electronics found in mobile phones , televisions and cars .
The technology is highly prized in Taiwan .
Market analysts believe the assistance involved a technology transfer from UMC to hejian and the compensation through the stake represents a payment .
No cash changed hands .
Tsao said the letter followed a verbal promise made by hejian technology to pay UMC a reasonable amount of compensation .
That included a commitment to merge the two companies .
Tsao said no formal written agreements had been signed .
Both companies would next seek a strategic partnership if the Investment Commission approved the deal .
UMC is the world 's second largest wafer foundry and has recognized its investment in hejian which had previously been denied .
Taiwan authorities lifted a ban in March 2002 on mainland - bound investment in eight - inch ( 200 millimeter ) silicon wafer plants .
This followed assurances from potential investors that the island would not lose out on transferred technology .
Prosecutors raided the homes and offices of UMC executives in February 2005 as part of a probe into the alleged illegal supply of funds , technology and human resources to hejian .
Hejian was founded in November 2001 with capital of 350 million U.S. dollars .
Its Chairman Hsu Chien - hua has been barred from leaving Taiwan after being bailed out of police custody for 10 million Taiwan dollars .
Tsao and UMC vice chairman John hsuan have also been named as defendants in on - going investigations .
UMC has never sought government approval for China - bound investments .
The company has previously called hejian technology a friendly company while denying any financial ties between the two .
Only UMC peer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has received official approval to build a plant in Shanghai .
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is the world 's biggest contract microchip - maker .

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen opened the meeting and stated --
Regional cross - border crime flourishes due to increasingly open borders and more amicable economic and social relations among countries in the region .
Producing and trafficking illegal drugs is only 1 aspect of organized transnational crime .
Money Laundering is a particular concern for the Mekong Sub - region because this money will fund terrorist activities .
Cambodia is considered an increasingly important trans - shipment point for illicit drugs in the region .
Myanmar is the 2nd largest opium producer globally and the United States has criticized Myanmar for failing to meet international anti - drug commitments .

Experts warn of new cyber attack encrypting documents and extorting payment for decryption .
1 case reported with potentially many in future .
Software protection companies warn of a new form of cyper - attack called ransomware .
If it installs successfully , ransomware encrypts text files and displays a ransom note demanding 200 dollars to supply decryption software to restore the data to its original form .
20050601 anti - virus program manufacturer Symantec stated on its website ( http://www.Symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/Trojan.pgpcoder.html ) that the attacking program is a Trojan horse .
Trojan horses do not replicate from machine to machine as viruses do .
Symantec stated that the ransomware enters the computer via weaknesses in the victim 's Web browser and then scans the hard drive and encrypts any text - based documents found .
20050604 the British weekly New Scientist stated that 1 case of ransomware has been discovered which may pioneer a new and dangerous generation of malicious software .
The known ransomware program is titled pgpcoder in an attempt to undermine the legal , popular and highly secure encryption product pretty good privacy .
New Scientist stated that the California web - filtering company websense discovered pgpcoder and notified the FBI .
Pgpcoder used an unsophisticated algorithm to encrypt the data so that a computer consultant was able to decode the documents easily .
New Scientist stated that future virus writers may compel victims to pay by encrypting files using military - grade systems .
Ransomware 's weakness is that the demand includes a traceable contact email address and electronic bank account .

On June 3 , 2005 Israeli military officials stated in the New York Times that Syria test fired three Scud missiles a week ago in an act of defiance to the United States and the United Nations .
One of the missiles broke up over two Turkish villages .
It caused no injuries .
The officials stated the missile tests were normal .
It was Syria 's first since 2001 and caused embarrassment to Turkey .
Syria decided to make the missile tests public because the U.S. silence about them was unsettling .
The Israeli officials in Tel Aviv told the daily that the missile tests were part of a Syrian missile development project using North Korean technology .
The three missiles were the older Scud B that has a range of 300 kilometers ( 185 miles ) and two Scud D 's with a range of 700 kilometers ( 435 miles ) .
The missiles are designed to deliver air - burst chemical weapons .
The official said the launchings on May 27 , 2003 were Syrian President Bashir al-Assad 's response to U.S. and UN pressures that forced al-Assad to withdraw Syrian troops from neighboring Lebanon .
This was in the wake of the February assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Harari .
A senior Israeli military official said the tests are probably needed for the missile project but Bashir is taking a risk and sending a message .
Anti - Syrian journalist Samir kassir was killed June 2 , 2005 when a bomb exploded under kassir 's car in Beirut .
The attack is blamed on the pro - Syrian regime and widely condemned at home and abroad .
Syria angrily denied the accusations through its official news agency , SANA .
The Israeli officials said the Syrian missiles were launched from northern Syria Newar minakh .
One was sent about 400 kilometers ( 250 miles ) to southernmost Syria near the Jordanian border .
The missile that that broke up was launched southwest toward the Mediterranean , over the Turkish province of Hatay and shed debris over two villages there .
The Israelis said they had film of the launching and breakup .
The Turkish Ambassador to the United States Osman Faruk Logoglu told The New York Times there were no casualties in the missile breakup .
Osman Faruk Logoglu added that Syria had apologized for the technical mishap .

The China Times stated that the Hsiung Feng cruise missile was developed by the military - run chungshan Institute of Science and Technology , has a range of 1,000 kilometers ( 600 miles ) and could be used to attack military bases in southeast China .
The China Times stated that once the missile was deployed it would mark the first time that Taiwan is able to put strategic weapons into use and that the political and military impact of this would be far - reaching .
The Times said Defense Minister Lee jye witnessed the test firing of the missile from chiupeng military base in the southern Pingtung County and that the missile flew over 500 kilometers ( 300 miles ) before hitting its target .
The defense ministry declined to comment on the report .
The report did not specify when the test took place but speculated that it could have been in March .
The missile is expected to go into pilot production later in 050000 or 060000 .
Taiwan is striving to build up its missile defense capabilities to counter the military threat from China .
Officials state that China has targeted Taiwan with approximately 700 ballistic missiles .
Taiwan 's cabinet approved a revised arms deal with the United States in 050500 worth almost 15.5 billion dollars after a previous proposal was rejected by parliament .
The arms package over a 15 - year period beginning in 050000 includes 8 conventional submarines , a modified version of the Patriot anti - missile system and a fleet of anti - submarine aircraft .
The package is pending final approval by Parliament .
This large budget proposal has provoked debate Taiwan as critics said the spending could further provoke China and heighten cross - strait tensions .
China considers Taiwan part of its territory awaiting reunification since they split at the end of the civil war in 490000 , and has repeatedly threatened to invade if Taiwan moves towards formal independence .

Brazilian government and Abbott Laboratories agree on lower price for AIDS drug Kaletra in response to Brazilian threat to violate the patent .
According to WHO studies the price of the drug was exorbitant and the Brazilian government demanded that Abbot lower the price .
On 08 July 2005 Brazil 's Ministry of Health stated that U.S. company Abbott Laboratories has agreed to reduce the price of its HIV / AIDS drug Kaletra to prevent Brazil from violating the company 's patent as it had threatened .
The ministry said in a statement --
The agreement made with Abbott guarantees the Ministry 's proposed objectives ensuring a significant price cut for the drug over the next 6 years .
Abbott agreed to a technology transfer procedure so that Brazil 's state - run farmanguinhos laboratories can begin producing Kaletra in 2009 .
The agreement guarantees access to Meltrex by Brazilian patients .
Meltrex is an updated version of Kaletra that is pending approval by U.S. health authorities .
Over the 6 years which the Agreement covers Brazil expects to save up to 259 million U.S. dollars in drug purchases .
The Ministry recently stated that an agreement with Abbott would save Brazil 18 million U.S. dollars in its 2006 budget to provide AIDS patients free anti - AIDS treatment consisting of a cocktail of anti - retroviral drugs including Kaletra .
Currently 24000 patients in Brazil receive Kaletra .
The number is expected to increase to 60000 by 2011 .
On 24 June 2005 Brazil declared Kaletra a drug of national interest and demanded that Abbott decide within 10 days to either agree to lower its price for the drug or face a violation of its patent .
On 24 June 2005 Brazilian Health Minister Humberto Costa stated that the price paid by the Brazilian Government to purchase Kaletra represented a yearly cost of 2630 U.S. dollars per patient .
Costa stated that this price is considered exorbitant because studies of the World Health Organization ( WTO ) showed that for large - scale production the fair price including a considerable margin of profit should range from 480 to 540 U.S. dollars per patient per year .
Costa stated that Brazil planned to have a less expensive generic copy of the patented drug produced locally by a state - owned company .
Illinois - based Abbott stated that Brazil 's demands were illegal and warned that developing unproven alternative HIV medication posed significant consequences for patients .
Abbott stated that it remained open to an agreeable solution .

Pakistani analysts say that Pakistan 's network of madrassas has close links with Islamic extremists in Britain , who supply them with extremist recruits and funding .
Pakistani analysts said on 050715 that Pakistan 's network of madrassa Islamic schools has close links with Islamic extremists in Britain , who supply them with extremist recruits and vital funding .
On 050714 British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw expressed concern over what goes on in some Pakistani madrassas .
It has emerged that Shehzad Tanweer was one of the terrorists who carried out the bombing of an underground subway train at Aldgate in east London .
Tanweer was said by his uncle to have gone in 041200 to a Pakistani madrassa , wanting to learn to recite the Koran by heart .
Sources in Pakistan said that British authorities should look inside British borders where the South Asian community is turning to increasingly extremist religious views .
Kamila hyat of Pakistan 's Human Rights Commision said that militancy is being exported in the reverse direction .
Younger Pakistanis coming from Britain have very extreme and hard - line views and view British culture as decadent .
When Pakistani - British youngsters come to Pakistan they are surprised to see women walking around without burqas .
Analysts say Tanweer 's trip to Pakistan was by no means unusual , as many Pakistani families who emigrated some 40 or 50 years ago and settled in Britain send their children for religious teaching at madrassas .
Hyat said they want to ensure their children are not alienated from their family faith and hope a brief stint of a few terms will help ground them in Islamic and Pakistani culture .
Hyat said that complaints have nonetheless been received from parents in Pakistan who are very concerned about teenagers who graduate and then go back to the UK for University .
The parents of some madrassa students are saying that the young men are somewhat confused when away from the UK for the first time and are consistently being approached by other Pakistanis or by Arabs who attempt to get them to join extremist groups .
Such students bring extremism back to the UK when coming back home .
Madrassas continue to produce a peculiar state of mind in students , said Hasan Askari .
Askari is the former head of political science department at Lahore 's Punjab University .
Askari said that these students having a state of mind of religious orthodoxy are vulnerable to violence and extremism .
Some of the radical religious schools in Pakistan have thrived on funds regularly coming from supporters among the Muslim community in Britain .
Security sources say that in one case , several thousand pounds were sent to outlawed Sipah - e - Sahaba of Pakistan in 030000 .
Pakistani security officials informed the British authorities and identified the man who sent the money as Mullah Hamid .
Mullah Hamid was a prayer leader in a mosque in Glasgow .
Pakistan admits that some of the estimated 10,000 madrassas in Pakistan are breeding grounds for extremism .
Madrassas have been a part of Muslim social life on the Indian subcontinent for decades .
In the 1980s they became a recruiting ground for the US - sponsored militant movement against the Soviet occupation of neighboring Afghanistan .
President Pervez Musharraf has been campaigning since early 030000 for reform of madrassas .
Many madrassas are unregulated and the International Crisis Group says 1.5 million students attend such Islamic schools .
Education Minister Javed Ashraf stated on 050715 that efforts were working to get madrassa leaders to broaden the curriculum beyond rote Koranic learning and to encompass useful and employable skills .

20050705 terrorist attacks may prompt counter - extremism measures sufficient to force Islamist militant organizations in London into convert operations via the Internet .
Anti - terrorist laws in the UK strengthened and suspected extremists were pursued more aggressively after the 20010911 attacks in the US .
The 20050707 terrorist attacks that killed 56 on London underground trains and a double - decker bus prompted demands for further anti - terror laws and surveillance of Islamist militants .
Director of the Center for the Study of terrorism at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland Magnus ranstorp stated that the militants may be forced underground into the cybersphere , which has potential utility for command , communication , and especially recruitment .
Londonistan is the Islamist core operating in London .
The two main components of londonistan are the international Jihad Movement and the exiled opposition to current Arab or Muslim regimes .
Londonistan emerged in the 1990s because London was a center for finance and Arabic media and because of Britain 's lenient asylum laws .
20050718 the Royal Institute of International Affairs ( Chatham House ) stated --
By the mid - 1990s British intelligence agencies and police were aware that London was expanding as a base for promoters , funders , and planners of terrorism in the Middle East and elsewhere .
Officials did not perceive any threat to national security and the individuals continued their activities with relative impunity .
Ranstorm stated that the militants have previously cautiously avoided incitement to violence .
Foreign Governments opposed the British government 's passive policy .
Government crackdown --
In 2004 British authorities dismantled the Finsbury Park mosque in London , the previous venue of Salafist jihadists .
Since then the militants have moved to informal areas , study groups , and youth centers .
The former imam of Finsbury Park mosque is Egyptian - born Abu Hamza al-Masri .
Masri is crippled with 1 eye and 1 arm and is incarcerated in Belmarsh prison awaiting a 20060100 trial on charges of inciting racial hatred and murder .
Abu Qatada is a Palestinian considered the spiritual chief for Al-Qaeda in Europe .
He is under house arrest after serving 2.5 years at Belmarsh .
French researcher Dominique Thomas stated --
The remaining preachers must adopt a clandestine attitude or risk surveillance or arrest .
Islamist groups such as those seeking reform in Saudi Arabia , Egypt , or Libya will be stymied .
Londonistan 's imminent disappearance may force militants to seek a clandestine meeting place on the Internet .
There are a number of websites managed or administered from London and the Internet facilitates global connection .

China 's research and development spending will catch up with that of the EU in 090000 or 100000 if current spending trends continue .
Conditions for research and development in some emerging markets like China may be surpassing Europe 's , so European companies are transferring some of their investments there .
The Financial Times reported 051010 that in just 5 years China will be spending proportionally more on research and development than the European Union .
EU Commissioner for research Janez Potocnik told the Financial Times that the Chinese trend is extremely clear .
Potocnik said that China will catch up with the EU in 090000 or 100000 if the trend continues .
The Financial Times said research and development investment in China was 1.31 percent of GDP in 030000 but is rising at a double - digit rate .
The Financial Times said that at present growth rates , the EU 's public and private spending on research and development is set to rise from 1.93 percent of gross domestic product in 030000 to 2.2 percent in 100000 .
This is well short of the 3 percent target agreed by EU heads of government as part of the 020000 Lisbon Strategy .
Potocnik was quoted as saying that the conditions for research and development in some emerging markets like China are improving and it is obvious that European companies are transferring some of their investments there .
Potocnik is worried about Europe 's unfavorable research and development environment ranging from excessive red tape to insufficient corporate tax incentives and continued divergences in intellectual property protection and patenting .
In response to the research and development boom in countries such as China and India , the EU government will this week table new proposals to help retain and attract research funding in the EU .
An EU government plan to double the EU 's own research and development budget to 70 billion euro over 060000-110000 was shelved in June amid a dispute among EU leaders over future EU funding .

Deadly attacks in India continue despite deaths of Pakistani Kashmir rebels and destruction of group infrastructure due to earthquake .
There is conflicting opinion as to the extent of damage suffered by the insurgency .
Rebel fighting continues despite losses suffered by Islamic rebels in Pakistan - ruled Kashmir in the massive earthquake .
The Indian government is attempting to assess the extent of losses suffered by rebels .
Police stated that on 18 October 2005 2 militants entered the fortified Srinagar home of junior Education Minister Ghulam Nabi lone of the People 's Democratic Party ( PDF ) and shot him to death .
2 policemen and 1 of the attackers also died and 5 others were injured in the gunfight .
The attack occurred less than 1 day after suspected rebels shot and killed a prominent communist politician in Indian Kashmir .
The daily violence has continued despite a ceasefire declaration in areas affected by the 08 October 2005 earthquake .
The violence that has occurred since the earthquake has been attributed to an umbrella group of separatists called the United Jihad Council .
Some insurgents have joined relief efforts .
The Indian military has not reacted to insurgents ' relief efforts and has continued counter - insurgency operations .
The army states that while it directs aid work it has also killed more than 30 militants since the earthquake .
Federal Intelligence agencies have been working to assess the damage to insurgents in and around Muzaffarabad .
Muzaffarabad is the militants ' headquarters and the capital of Pakistani Kashmir .
Army chief General J. J. Singh stated --
The epicenter of the 7.6 - magnitude earthquake was in Muzaffarabad and caused damage among the militant groups .
All the terrorist infrastructure in and around Muzaffarabad was destroyed and many innocent people died .
It is premature to state with certainty what impact the earthquake has had on the militant groups as infrastructure remains intact in other areas in Pakistan .
The militant groups are seeking either independence for Kashmir or absorption into Pakistan .
Over 1300 people in Indian Kashmir and 41000 people in Pakistan were killed in the earthquake .
The Indian government accuses the Pakistani government of training , arming and funding the Islamic rebellion .
The Pakistani government denies this charge but states that it does extend moral , political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists .
Head of military operations in Indian Kashmir Brigadier Madan Gopal expressed confidence on 17 October 2005 that many of the militants had been killed .
Gopal stated that the Hizbul Mujahedin and the Lashkar - e - Toiba have suffered major losses in the earthquake on the Pakistani side .
Hizbul Mujahedin and Lashkar - e - Toiba are groups that carry out frequent attacks .
Violence continues despite conflicting opinion on the extent of damage suffered by the rebel groups .
Retired General V. N. Sharma rejects suggestions that the earthquake has critically damaged the core of the insurgency .
Sharma was India 's army chief when the insurgency erupted in 1989 .
Sharma states that such suggestions are unrealistic .
Sharma states that he does not think the insurgency has been destroyed because the groups are mobile units and live in tented accommodations .
Sharma states that the destruction of a few communications centers or sub - command posts has little affect on the Greater organization .
Approximately 44000 people have died in the insurgency .
Head of the Military - funded Institute of Defense studies and analysis in New Delhi Uday Bhaskar also warned against complacency stating that loss of firepower and manpower is unimportant .
Bhaskar stated that the militants will soon regroup because they are highly motivated and believe they can achieve their goal of freeing Kashmir from Indian control with violence .
The Indian government is also taking a cautious approach .
Indian Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee on 17 October 2005 called for vigilance along the 430 - mile de facto border which divides the two Kashmirs .
Mukherjee stated --
Militants have attempted to infiltrate Indian Kashmir approximately 5 times since 08 October 2005 including twice on a single day .
Some of the militants wanted to take advantage of the unstable situation in the region .
The presence of civilians among the troops on relief work could help militants cross the de facto border .
There could be more infiltration attempts next week before winter snow blocks the mountain passes .

During a 4 - day tour of France Chinese Prime Minister Wen states that French company Areva must improve its offer for a nuclear reactor deal with regard to price and technology transfer .
Wen also signed a deal to initiate student exchange programs and attempted to allay anxiety about China 's rapidly growing power .
On 06 December 2005 Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao stated that in order to win a contract to build third - generation nuclear reactors in China France must improve its offer in terms of both cost and transfers of technology .
Wen was speaking on the 3rd day of a 4 - day visit to France .
On a tour of the elite Polytechnique Science University in the southern suburbs of Paris Wen stated that China hopes France will offer more attractive conditions on technology transfer as well as price so that Franco - Chinese cooperation in this field can develop .
The French company Areva is bidding for an 8 billion U.S. dollar ( 6.8 billion euro ) deal to construct 4 reactors in China as are U.S. company Westinghouse and Russian company atomstroyexport .
The bidding among the 3 companies has been competitive .
China was to have announced a winner by the end of 2005 but has delayed its decision until early next year hoping to elicit better terms from the bidders .
On 05 December 2005 during the 4 - day visit to France a Chinese order for 150 medium - range A 320 airliners from the European consortium Airbus was announced .
Airbus also signed a protocol that could lead to aircraft being constructed in China .
Prime Minister Wen held talks in Paris with French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and French President Jacques Chirac and was then to depart the afternoon of 06 December 2005 to Marseille to visit the headquarters of the helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter .
On 05 December 2005 Eurocopter announced a 600 million Euro partnership deal with China to share development and production of a new 16 - seat aircraft called the ec175 .
Wen is scheduled to visit the site of the future experimental nuclear fusion reactor ITER in which China is a partner .
On 07 December 2005 Wen is scheduled to tour the space - satellite facility of telecommunications company Alcatel in Cannes .
Wen departs on 07 December 2005 for Slovakia , the Czech Republic and Portugal .
1 of the reasons for Wen 's visit to the 200 year - old Polytechnique at palaiseau was to sign a partnership deal with three Chinese universities that will introduce new exchange programs and shared qualifications .
Wen stated --
The dynamic young students represented the future of the world .
Student exchanges are more important than the purchase of 150 Airbus .
At present there is economic cooperation between China and France but with such programs in the future there will be cultural cooperation .
In a speech to students , professors and business leaders , Wen attempted to allay anxiety in Europe that China 's fast - growing economic power is a threat to the rest of the world .
Wen stated that because China suffered so much from foreign invasions it understands the value of peace .
Wen stated that for China to choose peace is logical given its history and culture .
China 's development is not a threat but an opportunity for the world .
The French have expressed fear that China 's low costs and poor standards of social security are attracting economic activity and causing increased unemployment in Europe but Wen argued that growing domestic demand in China will eventually lead to new opportunities for foreign exporters .
France views China as a strategic ally in its pursuit of a multipolar world that is not dominated by the U.S. though trade relations between France and China remain low .
France ranks 15th among suppliers to China providing only 1.4 percent of China 's foreign needs .

China did not comment on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 's claims that China 's satellite - destroying test had broken international law .
China 's Foreign Ministry refused to react directly to Abe 's comments that Beijing had violated an International Space Treaty when it shot down one of its own satellites with a missile on January 11 , 2007 .
Spokeswoman Jiang Yu said China had already stated China 's position .
Many other countries are concerned about the peaceful uses of outer space .
The countries oppose the weaponization of space and an arms race in space .
China wants them to make common efforts to realize this goal .
Abe said to the Japanese parliament on January 31 , 2007 that Abe believed China 's test was not in compliance with basic international rules such as the Outer Space Treaty .
The 1967 UN treaty bans weapons of mass destruction in space and said that all nations should avoid contamination of space and be held liable for any damage caused .
The United States is concerned that debris from the Chinese test could damage satellites or the manned international space station .
Jiang Yu said she was not aware of the specific information concerning space debris .
Yu insisted that China would be a force for peace and stability .
Jiang Yu said China has not and will not participate in an arms race with other countries and will not threaten any other country .
China said it had the right to carry out the test after destroying the satellite .
The United States and the then Soviet Union are the only other nations to have carried similar tests .
Both stopped the practice in 1985 partly over concerns about the debris left in space .

Authorizing of EU sanctions against North Korea meets difficulties due to Britain 's disagreement with Spain over the sovereignty of Gibraltar .
Diplomatic sources said on 070208 that EU sanctions against North Korea cannot go forward due to Britain 's disagreement with Spain over the sovereignty of Gibraltar inhibiting Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary from being listed as one of the required competent authorities .
The European Union decided in 061100 to ban the export of arms and nuclear and missile technology as well as luxury products in compliance with the UN resolution number 1718 adopted after Pyongyang carried out nuclear tests in 061000 .
The EU also introduced restrictions of entry to the EU for individuals deemed to be aiding North Korea 's programs for nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .
Before the measures are applied , the legal sanctions document requires a list of authorities , banks and other bodies in each Member State which would supervise compliance with the sanctions and freeze assets .
British spokeswoman Vicky Courtney in Brussels said Britain insisted that Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary be listed as the competent authority as had done on previous occasions without Spain making any complaint .
Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary acts as the link between the gibraltan government and the British government and Governor .
Another diplomatic source , said the Spanish government was afraid that any mention of a gibraltan authority would constitute a precedent in relations between the EU and Gibraltar and so opposed the move this time .
The Government of Spain insists that Britain should be named in the annex to the document but not Gibraltar .
The Spanish Government refuses to afford any international legitimacy to Gibraltar .
The UK and Spain are seeking to reach a formula which would satisfy both sides .
The 2 EU nations have thus far failed to do so .
Courtney said there is some frustration with the fact that the sanctions are being held up .
Courtney added that it is important to find a constructive solution applicable to this and other documents in future and said that the application of other sanctions also runs the risk of being blocked .
Other EU - levied sanctions include those against Iran over the Iranian nuclear program .
Gibraltar was ceded in perpetuity to Britain by Spain under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht , however Madrid still claims sovereignty .
Gibraltarians in 020000 overwhelmingly rejected moves by Britain and Spain to move towards joint sovereignty for Gibraltar and Gibraltar 's 30000 inhabitants .

Kadhafi warns that US and Britain 's failure to compensate Libya for nuclear disarmament will deter Iran and North Korea from disarming .
20070302 Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi stated in an interview published on the BBC website --
Britain , the EU and the US have not invested in Libya following the country 's abandonment of its nuclear weapons program .
Western countries ' failure to sufficiently compensate Libya will deter Iran and North Korea from disarming .
Other countries should emulate Libya 's example but the example has been destroyed because the US and Britain did not fulfill their promises .
Kadhafi stated --
Libya may still cooperate with Western countries for mutual benefit .
The lack of foreign support will not cause Libya to return to hostile pursuits .
Kadhafi spoke with the BBC from the 30th anniversary celebration of Libya 's Jamahiriyah ( State of the masses ) political system in Sebha .
In 2003 Kadhafi normalized Libya 's relations with Britain , France and the US by pledging to abandon attempts to develop nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction .
Kadhafi had been widely condemned by the international community in previous decades due to opposition to Western countries and alleged support of terrorism .

Wirajuda said terrorists must be stopped without resorting to repressive and undemocratic measures like the violation of human rights or disregard of due process of law .
Wirajuda added that terrorists had been evolving new strategies and tactics and thus are becoming an even greater threat to peace , security and progress .
Wirajuda stated there was a need for better ways of denying terrorists access to weapons of mass destruction and that more effective ways of denying the terrorists access to deadly weapons and especially weapons of great killing power must be devised .
Wirajuda said that vigilance and innovative measures were key to an adequate response to the terrorist threat .
Downer hoped the countries at the meeting could agree on cooperation to stop terrorists acquiring unconventional weapons and to improve law enforcement , intelligence sharing and the response to attacks causing mass casualties .
The Jakarta conference follows an earlier counter - terrorism meeting in Bali in 040200 attended by ministers from 20 Southeast Asian and Pacific countries .

Peace activists from Greenpeace climbed a crane on the River Thames outside Britain 's houses of parliament and called MPs to campaign against Prime Minister Tony Blair 's plans to renew the UK 's nuclear deterrent .
Peace activists climbed a crane on the River Thames outside Britain 's houses of parliament on 070313 to campaign against Prime Minister Tony Blair 's plans to renew the UK 's nuclear deterrent .
4 protesters from Greenpeace clambered an estimated 200 feet up the maintenance crane moored on the river and unfurled a banner suggesting Blair loved weapons of mass destruction .
Greenpeace said in a statement that the activists scaled the structure at about 6:00 am GMT and were phoning and attempting to persuade members of parliament ( MP ) to vote against the government .
A Greenpeace spokesman said the 4 volunteers aim to occupy the crane until the vote takes place and hope to telephone as many MPs as possible urging rejection of new weapons of mass destruction .
Lawmakers in the UK parliament 's lower House of Commons are to debate and vote on 070314 whether to back Blair 's controversial 38 - billion - dollar plan to replace the US - built Trident missile system .
Nuclear weapons are still a divisive issue in Blair 's governing Labour Party as unilateral nuclear disarmament was once official labour policy in the 800000 .
Many traditionalists accuse Blair of stifling debate on the subject and claim Trident is a costly and obsolete relic of the cold war and is no longer required .
Deputy Leader of the Commons Nigel Griffiths resigned on 070312 so as to be able to vote against Blair 's government and was joined on 070313 by junior health department aide Jim Devine .
A widespread rebellion from rank - and - file Labour lawmakers is widely predicted .
A BBC Radio poll on 070311 said 64 out of the 101 Labour MPs whom were asked expressed opposition to Blair 's plans .
A further 15 Labour MPs were undecided .
22 backed the proposals .
Lobby group the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ( CND ) on 070313 said 62 Labour MPs and a total of 105 MPs overall had signed an amendment to the vote calling for more time to discuss the issue .
Blair is not expected to lose the vote but will have to rely on the support of the main opposition Conservative Party .
The conservatives broadly back Blair 's plans for a new submarine - based weapons system .

The Secretary General has dismissed suggestions that turning the Disarmament Department into an office signified de - emphasis and said the office would instead report directly to the UN Secretary - General and would ensure access and more frequent interaction .
Developing countries have criticized the larger Powers on disarmament and specifically for failing to reduce nuclear arsenals while insisting on non - proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction .
Ban announced plans soon after taking office on 070101 to reform the UN 's sprawling peacekeeping operations and tighten control over disarmament matters .
The peacekeeping and disarmament reforms were strongly backed by Western countries and faced initial resistance from developing countries .
This resistance prompted ban to launch a process of consultations with the General Assembly to explain the ideas for reform .

An Indonesian official says Indonesia agreed to further UN sanctions against Iran over the disputed atomic program because the sanctions promote the goal of a nuclear weapons - free Middle East .
Indonesia 's Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said on 070326 that Muslim - majority Indonesia agreed to further UN sanctions against Iran over the Iranian government 's disputed atomic program because the sanctions promote the goal of a nuclear weapons - free Middle East .
Wirajuda said the Indonesian government was supporting implementation of a nuclear weapons - free zone in the Middle East and pointed out that Israel is the only country in the Middle East which possesses nuclear weapons .
A clause which emphasized that resolving the Iranian nuclear issue would help to realize the objective of a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction was included in the sanctions resolution at the request of Indonesia and Qatar .
Some commentators have criticized Indonesia for backing the sanctions because such a stance could diminish Indonesia 's standing among Muslim nations .
Wirajuda said the proposition introduced in the UN resolution for a nuclear weapons - free zone in the Middle East is supported by Arabic countries .
The resolution was passed unanimously on 070324 after days of hard bargaining by the Security Council 's 15 members .
Indonesia currently holds one of the Council 's rotating seats .
The sanctions block all Iranian arms exports and freeze the overseas assets of 28 additional officials and institutions linked to Iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and restrict financial aid or loans to the Iranian government while setting a new 60 - day deadline for the Iranian government to comply with UN demands or face further appropriate measures .
The Iranian government reacted angrily and expressed intent to restrict cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog IAEA in retaliation .

Japan on March 27 , 2007 deployed troops to Nepal to monitor Nepal 's ceasefire .
This was the first military mission since Japan created a full - fledged Defense Ministry .
Officially Japan is a pacifist nation .
A Defense Ministry official said that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 's cabinet decided at a meeting to dispatch six soldiers to Nepal to observe arms control for a year .
Japan will help monitor weapons and soldiers under the peace accord that ended Nepal 's decade - long Maoist insurgency .
Nepal is in the Himalayas .
Japan is a major donor to Nepal .
Japan was forced by the United States to renounce its right to armed forces after World War II and has been slowly expanding its military operations overseas .
Japan created a full - fledged Defense Ministry in January 2007 for the first time since 1945 .
Japan upgraded the former defense agency which was lower in rank than cabinet - level ministries .
Abe 's conservative government also listed overseas peacekeeping activities as a mission for Japan 's military because of the change .
They are known as the self - defense forces .
Deployments abroad had been previously considered extraordinary and led the Government to seek parliamentary approval .
Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma told reporters that this is the first time Japan will deploy the Self - Defense Force abroad since peacekeeping became one of the main missions for the troops .
Kyuma said that Japan has to pay careful attention to the security .
Japan sent 600 troops in its most prominent deployment to Iraq on a reconstruction mission .
The soldiers returned last year without suffering any casualties or firing a shot .

The decision was delayed by an argument between Britain and Spain concerning the method in which Gibraltar would implement the measures .
The resolution was passed after the North Korean government announced that it had performed its first nuclear weapons test on October 9 , 2006 .
The announcement triggered world - wide outrage .

Illegal arms trafficking increases in Kenya due to easy availability and neighboring conflicts .
Government initiatives to disarm have been ineffective .
Illegal arms trafficking has increased in Kenya and raised concern about security .
Daniel kiptugen of Oxfam stated that there are approximately 140,000 illegal arms in circulation in Kenya among the most vulnerable and marginalized groups .
Illegal weapons are easily procured in urban open - air markets despite a government initiative launched in 2006 to curb the availability of arms .
Kenyan security minister John Michuki recently stated at a ceremony burning 8000 illegal arms seized in 2006 to prevent the spread of firearms --
Firearms fuel the illegal exploitation of natural resources and abet terrorism and other crimes .
The easy affordability and accessibility of arms reduces incentives to pursue non - violent solutions to conflicts and initiates a spiral of insecurity .
Police stated that conflicts along Kenya 's borders have increased the number of weapons in the area .
Conflicts include a 20 - year insurgency in Uganda , anarchy in Somalia since 1991 and the former civil war in Sudan .
Police spokesman Gideon kibunjah stated --
Kenya has always experienced serious arms trafficking but the free sale of arms in Somalia presents an additional problem .
Weapons smuggling has increased since 20061200 when Ethiopian - Somali troops eradicated an Islamist movement from south and central Somalia .
Mogadishu experienced chaos and arms control at the border with Kenya became a low - priority issue .
Kenya has participated since 2000 in a regional treaty to control and reduce the number of illegal arms in the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa but has achieved limited success in disarmament .
Kiptugen stated --
The impact of government disarmament programs had not yet been apparent .
Forced disarmament process has never been successful because it fails to address the impetus of the demand : competition for natural resources and a lack of government security forces .
Pastoral communities in northern Kenya frequently resolve tribal conflicts concerning water and land access by gun battles .
Communities consider guns a means of self - protection and protection of the community 's livelihood .
Gun Control activist Walter Odhiambo stated that increased economic inequity in Kenya is a catalyst for violence .
2/3 of the population subsists on under 1 dollar per day .
The Kenyan government has increased promises to augment security measures before President Mwai Kibaki contends for re - election in 20071200 .
The US issued a travel advisory to US citizens warning of increasing incidents of violent crime after 2 Americans were shot and killed in Kenya in 20070100 .
Kenya has struggled to overcome a reputation of high crime rates and frequent terrorist threats after the country experienced deadly terrorist attacks in 1998 and 2002 , ongoing tribal conflicts and a crime wave that killed 50 in 20070100 .
Kenya was previously considered relatively stable compared to surrounding countries in the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa ridden with regional conflicts .

Thailand 's Defense Ministry has decided to develop and produce rockets and missiles .
Jane 's Defence Weekly reported on 070412 that the Thai Government has decided to develop and produce rockets and missiles in a radical shift towards building an indigenous defense industry .
Jane 's said the program would lift Thailand beyond the current capacity for producing explosives , ammunition and small arms under licence as well as modernizing and repairing aircraft and armored vehicles .
The Thai armed forces do not currently have any surface - to - surface missiles in their inventory .
Jane 's cited an internal Thai Defense Ministry document which said Thailand will start by developing a multiple - launch rocket ( MLR ) with a range of 80 kilometers ( 48 miles ) .
Jane 's said there is already a project underway to develop a 160 millimeter MLR with a 40 - kilometer range and that other projects include a strategic rocket with turbojet engine guided by Global Position System and inertial navigation system .
The Thai Ministry document says funding pressures on the defense budget and encouragement by unspecified sectors for greater self - sufficiency is driving the new program .
Such a rocket is significant because of the implication of efforts to develop a surface - to - surface missile with a range at the upper limit of the voluntary Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) .
The MTCR is a global disarmament group involving the United States and 33 other members and was established in 870000 to control exports of missiles which can deliver weapons of mass destruction .
Thailand 's King bhumipol Adulyadej enjoys strong support from the armed forces which overthrew the Thai government in a bloodless coup in 060900 and has called for a sufficiency economy .
Jane 's added that the new research and development program was launched before the coup but gained formal approval upon submission to the country 's Defense Council about a month afterwards .

Members of Egypt 's opposition Muslim Brotherhood on trial in Egyptian military court including high - ranking businessman thought to fund the Organization .
Defense lawyers boycotted the closed - door session arguing that they had not been made aware of the trial dates .
A judicial source stated that approximately 40 members of Egypt 's opposition movement Muslim Brotherhood went on trial at a military court on 26 April 2007 charged with belonging to a banned organization and funding terrorism .
Defense lawyers boycotted the closed - door session arguing that they had not been made aware of the dates of the Tribunal .
Family members were initially banned from the proceedings but were eventually permitted entrance .
Family members stated that the defendants remained silent during proceedings because their counsel was not present .
Journalists , family members and diplomatic observers have been allowed into the courtroom for past military trials of Islamists .
The courtroom is at a military base in the desert outside Cairo .
The session on 26 April 2007 was approximately 4 hours in duration and was adjourned until 03 June 2007 .
Defendants included Khayrat Al-Shater who ranks number 3 in the hierarchy of the Muslim Brotherhood .
As part of the Government 's repression of Egypt 's largest opposition bloc Al-Shater was arrested in December 2006 following a university demonstration in which masked pro - Brotherhood students staged a military - style parade on the campus of Al-Azhar University in the capital city Cairo .
Al-Shater and other businessmen linked to the group had their assets frozen and were referred to a military court in February 2007 .
The targeting of Al-Shater and other businessmen associated with the movement has been considered an attempt to disable the Organization financially .
Egyptian authorities accuse the movement of seeking to reactivate its underground military wing with the aim of eventually overthrowing the regime .
The Muslin Brotherhood controls a fifth of the seats in Parliament .
The Government of Egypt began using military courts to try members of the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamic groups in the 1990s when they were not being convicted by civilian courts .
Under a law passed by Parliament last week the verdicts of military courts can now be appealed .

A conference of the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) will begin on 30 April 2007 in Vienna .
Experts stated the preparatory session can not change the treaty but is expected to focus on problems in fighting proliferation and in getting the 5 original nuclear weapons states to fulfill the NPT commitment to disarm .
A conference on the world 's nuclear non - proliferation treaty ( NPT ) against the spread of nuclear weapons opens on 30 April 2007 in Vienna .
The meeting will take place through 14 May 2007 and is the 1st of a series of Preparatory Committee sessions ahead of the next overall review in 2010 .
The NPT went into effect at the height of the Cold War in 1970 and was extended indefinitely in 1995 .
The NPT has 188 signatory States and is a deal in which nuclear weapons States agree to disarm while nations without the bomb agree not to seek the bomb .
The NPT is reviewed every 5 years .
The meeting in May 2005 failed to resolve any key questions due to an agenda disagreement between non - aligned countries and nuclear powers .
The NPT Conference occurs as --
The crisis over Iran 's atomic program escalates though Iran has not yet produced atomic bombs .
A deal to dismantle North Korea 's nuclear program which has produced atomic bombs has stalled .
A U.S. strategy to use pre - emptive force if judged necessary and Britian 's nuclear arsenal upgrade threaten the NPT .
Experts stated the NPT is ill adapted to the modern era in which so - called rogue States seek to acquire a nuclear weapons capacity by 1st developing peaceful programs under the terms of the treaty .
Experts stated that fixes should include tougher UN inspections and automatic penalties for countries who drop out of the treaty .
The North Korean government withdrew from the NPT in 2003 after expelling United Nations inspectors .
The North Korean government tested an atomic bomb in October 2006 .
The Iranian government justifies nuclear work under article IV of the NPT which guarantees the inalienable right to develop research , production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
U.S. government stated that the Iranian government uses article IV as a cover for the secret development of nuclear weapons which the Treaty bans .
Non - proliferation analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington George perkovich stated the NPT is the most effective treaty in history and referred to the fact that predictions made in the 1960s that there would soon be 30-40 nuclear weapons States have not come to pass .
There are believed to be 9 nuclear weapons states .
The States are the 5 allowed under the NPT , Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States .
The States also include North Korea which withdrew from the treaty and 3 nuclear states including India , Pakistan and Israel which have refused to sign the NPT .
Diplomats and experts stated the preparatory session can not change the treaty but is expected to focus on problems in fighting proliferation and in getting the 5 original nuclear weapons states to fulfill the NPT commitment to disarm which is a focus of non - aligned States .
Nuclear and disarmement expert Rebecca Johnson wrote the week of 22 April 2007 on Johnson 's Acronym Institute website that the risk of nuclear proliferation is too grave for the international community to shirk responsibilities and that the NPT has already begun to unravel .
Felicity Hill of the non - governmental organization the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons ( ican ) stated to AFP that the meeting could build towards a successful 2010 Review Conference but progress must occur on both non - proliferation and disarmament .
A diplomat in Vienna who closely follows the non - proliferation regime stated that expectations are being lowered for a successful outcome to the Preparatory Committee given the inauspicious international developments and the growing detritus of arms control agreements cast aside .

An official stated that on 15 May 2007 Estonia 's 2nd - biggest bank , Swedish - owned Seb Eesti uhispank , blocked access from abroad to Seb Eesti uhispank 's online banking service after a cyber attack .
Head of communications at Seb Eesti uhispank silver vohu stated massive attacks were launched at 12:00 PM against the Internet bank which blocked access to the Seb Eesti uhispank website .
Vohu stated the attacks on Seb Bank 's Internet banking service had attempted to overload the website with various requests so that normal access would fail .
Vohu stated access was restored at 2:00 pm ( 1100 GMT ) for users in Estonia but access from computers located outside Estonia will continue to be restricted for security reasons .
Vohu stated that the security of customer accounts was not compromised in the attacks .
Vohu stated the cyber attacks were the first to target the Bank Group since a series of similar assaults were launched in April 2007 against the websites of Estonian state institutions .

On 21 May 2007 the Government of Estonia rejected European Union criticism of its handling of recent cyber attacks .
Estonia has experienced a series of cyber attacks since the end of April 2007 that have forced it to restrict access to many State websites .
Estonia is a Baltic State member of the European Union .
Hillar aarelaid is head of Estonia 's computer emergency response team cert .
Aarelaid was responding to comments made by Jacqueline McGlade .
McGlade is head of the EU agency that promotes a shared network of environmental data .
Aarelaid stated that McGlade 's assertion that Estonia should have employed basic procedures such as firewalls to defend from cyber attack demonstrated ignorance of the extent of the cyber assaults on Estonia .
Aarelaid stated to the AFP by phone on 21 May 2007 that if the solution had been as simple as using elementary firewalls that Estonia would have done it .
At a press conference in Geneva McGlade had stated that the EU agency she heads firmly believes that to react to cyber attack by closing systems down is unsound .
Estonia began barring access to key government and some private websites 3 weeks ago after the onset of a series of cyber attacks against Estonia .
Many of the attacks originated abroad .
The cyber attacks were triggered by Estonian government authorities ' decision to remove a Soviet war memorial from central Tallinn .
This decision angered Russia and the large ethnic Russian minority in Estonia .
Officials in Estonia including Prime Minister andrus Ansip have claimed that some of the cyber attacks came from Russian government computers including computers in the office of Russian President Vladimir Putin .
Aarelaid stated to AFP --
Critics of Estonia 's response may not be aware that traffic on some Estonian sites was increased by 1 million .
Imposing temporary restrictions on Internet traffic from abroad was inevitable .
Mcglade 's comments on the Estonian response were made in Geneva ahead of a United Nations conference on global access to information technology .
Mcglade stated that attacks on State and private websites should be handled in a systematic way instead of by restricting access .
Mcglade stated that there are technologies that the EU agency deploys in an effort to avoid restricting access to government websites .
The EU Agency will be in contact with the Estonian Government to advise on possible defense measures .
Estonia is a world pioneer in IT solutions .
Estonia ranks higher than the 15 older EU members and just behind the United States on a World Bank list of countries that are advanced in preparing for a knowledge - based society .
Aarelaid stated --
Access to critical websites was never restricted .
Estonia is prepared to keep critical websites accessible in any situation but that during a massive cyber attack some websites like that of the Estonian Agriculture Ministry are of a lower priority to keep accessible to visitors from abroad .

The KDX - III destroyer weighs 7600 tons .
The navy stated that the Republic of Korea is the 5th country to have a destroyer equipped with the Aegis integrated weapons control system following the United States , Japan , Spain and Norway .
The destroyer was built domestically at a cost of 1 billion U.S. dollars .
President Roh Moo - hyun stated at a launching ceremony that the ship is armed with a state - of - the - art defense system and combat capability and is one of the world 's best destroyers .
Roh stated that Republic of Korea will move forward with a program to create an ocean - going navy .
The destroyer is named the King Sejong after the monarch who helped create the Korean alphabet in the 15th century .
The navy said in a statement --
The King Sejong has integrated capabilities in broad - range air defense , support for ground operations , automatic tracking and destruction of enemy aircraft and guided and ballistic missiles .
The new destroyer is expected to greatly increase combat capabilities .
A 2nd Aegis destroyer will be launched in 2010 and a 3rd in 2012 in what a navy spokesman stated in May 2007 was an attempt to rival the naval powers of Japan and China .
The Republic of Korea faces a potential threat from the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea around their contested maritime border in the Yellow Sea .
This week the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea accused the Republic of Korea of dispatching warships to violate its territorial waters .
6 South Koreans were killed in June 2002 in battles in the area .
In June 1999 dozens of North Korean sailors were killed in a similar battle .
The Aegis combat system was built by the U.S. firm Lockheed Martin .
The Aegis combat system allows a ship to combat multiple surface , underwater and aerial targets .
The King Sejong is also equipped with locally developed ship - to - ship missiles and torpedoes as well as various ship - to - air missiles and ship - to - surface cruise missiles .
Stealth technology was used in building the King Sejong making radar detection more difficult .
The ship will be deployed operationally in 2009 .
The Republic of Korea is cooperating with Germany to build 1800 - ton modern submarines .
A second such submarine will be launched in early June 2007 .

Russia tests new multiple warhead missile capable of penetrating air - defense systems such as the U.S. shield planned for deployment in central Europe .
In response to U.S. plans Putin states that Russia will suspend its compliance with a European conventional weapons control treaty as Russia continues working to regain military parity with the U.S. .
On 29 May 2007 Russia stated it had successfully tested a new multiple warhead ballistic missile designed to overcome air - defense systems such as the U.S. shield planned for deployment in Central Europe .
Russia 's strategic missile forces issued a statement saying that the RS - 24 rocket was fired from the northeastern Arkhangelsk region and hit its target on the Kamchatka Peninsula 6000 kilometers away .
The Kamchatka peninsula protrudes into the Pacific Ocean .
According to the statement the RS - 24 reinforces the military potential of the strategic forces to overcome anti - missile defense systems .
The test occurred amidst Russia 's diplomatic battle over U.S. plans to expand a missile defense shield into Central Europe .
The Russian Government considers the U.S. plan an attempt to gain nuclear power in the region .
First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov is a former defense minister and widely considered a potential successor to President Vladimir Putin in 2008 .
Ivanov stated that the RS - 24 could overcome any anti - missile system like that of the United States .
Ivanov was quoted by Interfax as stating that the Russian missile complexes are capable of penetrating all existing and prospective anti - missile systems .
Ivanov stated that Russians should be confident in the nation 's defense and security capabilities .
The United States states that the planned radar base in the Czech Republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring Poland would defend Europe against potential threats from Iran and North Korea and pose no threat to Russia .
President Vladimir Putin disagrees and stated that Russia is suspending compliance with a European conventional weapons control treaty .
Putin warned that a new arms race is possible .
According to the statement the new rocket meets the standards of START - II missile treaties which impose restrictions on the use of multiple warhead missiles .
A spokesman for the strategic forces stated to the AFP that the missile is new but uses technologies of the Topol - M missile .
According to the statement the prototype RS - 24 rocket is unlike the Topol - M in that it is equipped with multiple independently targetable warheads to overwhelm defense systems .
The Ministry of Defense refused to reveal the characteristics of the new missile other than stating it was designed to replace the Soviet - era RS - 18 and RS - 20 rockets .
Director of the Moscow Center for Defense Information Ivan safranchuk stated --
The RS - 24 is a significant modernization of Topol - M.
The principle advantage is that the RS - 24 is a Russian rocket .
Other multiple warhead missiles that Russia utilized were built in Ukraine .
Prior to the RS - 24 there were no Russian - built multiple warhead missiles .
Military analyst Alexander golts stated that the test was part of a massive effort by the Russian government to regain parity with the United States ' strategic missile forces .
Golts stated that the principle military political aim of the current Russian leadership is to regain parity with the United States .

NATO member States and countries from the former Soviet bloc meet in Vienna to re - examine the CFE .
NATO member States and countries from the former Soviet bloc met in Vienna on 12 June 2007 to re - examine the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe ( CFE ) in light of tensions between Moscow and the West .
The CFE meeting was convened at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and will last until 15 June 2007 .
The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe was signed in Paris in 1990 and aimed at establishing defense parity in Europe .
The CFE came into force in 1992 and limits deployments of tanks and troops in countries belonging to NATO and the former Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe .
Chief of the Russian delegation Anatoly Antonov stated in Vienna on 11 June 2007 that Russian officials called the meeting because the Russian Government is unable to freely move Russian troops on Russian territory .
Anotov referred to limitations imposed by the CFE and stated that the choice of which armed forces to deploy belongs to Russian officials .
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently threatened to suspend application of the CFE amid disagreement with the government in Washington over US plans to extend a missile shield into Central Europe .
Russian and U.S. officials have disagreed over the CFE since 1999 with NATO officials stating that Russian officials have failed to honor commitments to withdraw troops from Moldova and Georgia .
Russian officials accuse the United States of a military buildup near Russia 's borders with the US planning new army bases in Romania and Bulgaria as well as the missile shield proposal .
Antonov stated that Russian officials have serious concerns over the plans for military bases .
On 26 April 2007 Putin cited NATO 's lack of movement and called for a freeze on Russian compliance with the CFE which disconcerted Western observers .
Antonov downplayed the idea that Russian officials would pull out of the CFE altogether and stated that the dispute over the US missile shield would not be discussed at the meeting .
Antonov stated that the US plans for military bases in Romania and Bulgaria will be on the meeting 's agenda .
Antonov rejected an offer made by the US and NATO allies to the Russian Government the week of 3 June 2007 to accept a multinational peacekeeping force in the pro - Russian Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestr .

The United Nations said on June 25 , 2007 that sophisticated laboratories inside Afghanistan are converting 90 percent of Afghanistan 's opium into heroin and morphine before smuggling it around the world .
The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) said Afghanistan is the world 's biggest producer of opium and had exported the illicit drug almost exclusively in its raw form until 2 years ago .
UNODC representative Christina Oguz in Kabul said that she believes the amount of the opium being processed in Afghanistan is approximately 90 percent .
Oguz said that anyone flying over the major opium producing areas would see a lot of small fires in the mountains , which are heroin labs .
Oguz stated that a couple of years ago opium was the primary drug being trafficked out of Afghanistan .
Oguz said there has been an increase of opium being processed into morphine and into heroin and that this indicates sophistication that was not previously present in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan accounts for 92 percent of the world 's heroin supply despite vast internationally - backed efforts to eradicate its opium poppy fields .
Oguz said the annual income from the drugs trade helps finance the Taliban - led insurgency plaguing mainly southern and eastern Afghanistan and that this income totals more than three billion US dollars .
Oguz stated that the drugs have to be fought together with the insurgency .
Afghanistan produced a record 6000 tons of opium in 2006 .
Officials said that the 2007 harvest could exceed the 2006 record because of an increase in opium cultivation in the southern provinces .
Oguz said that favorable weather conditions had also contributed to the increase .
Oguz fears that Afghanistan will have at least the same amount as the 2006 harvest if not more .
Oguz also downplayed international efforts to eradicate poppy crops and said that it was more important to provide poor opium farmers with alternative livelihoods .

Russia 's government announced withdrawal from the Conventional Forces in Europe arms control treaty in hopes that the accompanying uncertainty will pressure European regarding various military , economic , and political issues .
The Russian government announced on 070714 suspension of Russian adherence to the Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) arms control treaty .
The CFE is a key agreement that limits the deployment of forces in central and eastern Europe .
US moves to install anti - missile bases in the region were seen as a key cause of the decision .
Analysts said that it is Europe that is likely to suffer most from the decision 's consequences .
Independent defense analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said the CFE Treaty is much more important to the European countries than the US .
Felgenhauer pointed out that Russia has other problems with Europe and that this withdrawal is another factor reducing confidence and deteriorating relations especially with European countries .
Felgenhauer predicted that actual troop deployments are unlikely to change much and believed the biggest practical effect of Russia 's decision will be an end to mutual inspections and confidence - building measures governed by the Treaty .
Analysts said the hope in the Russian Government is that the uncertainty will weaken European resolve over a number of issues .
Interfax news agency cited Ivan safranchuk of the international center on defense information as saying that the situation will push Europe into a more active position on missile defense .
Europe has largely backed US plans for an anti - missile radar station in the Czech Republic and interceptor rockets in Poland .
The Russian government says the US plans threaten to upset the balance of power on the continent .
Other analysts were doubtful that attempts to pressure the EU would bear fruit .
Editor of the Moscow - based Journal Russia in global affairs Fyodor Lukyanov said the Russian government is hoping that Europe 's extreme unease over this will lead to a softening of Europe 's positions .
Lukyanov thinks the Russian government 's calculations are wrong and that a frightened Europe will join with the United States .
Lukyanov said the decision to freeze the CFE was part of a wider move by the Russian government to use newly found strength to remold the foundations of transatlantic relations and that the Russian government wants to revise the forces influencing interaction in the Euro - Atlantic area that were set when Russia was weaker .
Political analyst and director of Moscow 's Institute for globalization Boris Kagarlitsky said the Russian government also appears to be using its geopolitical strength to put pressure on Europe over business ties .
Kagarlitsky said the withdrawal from the Treaty will be seen in the West as an attempt to put pressure on a number of issues including in the economic sphere .
Disagreements over energy security and a dispute over deliveries of Polish meat have prevented Russian and European Union authorities from agreeing to a new mutual cooperation agreement .
Kagarlitsky said that at some stage the Russian government will put all of the economic issues on the table while expressing doubt whether the Russian government 's goals will be achieved .

Russia withdraws from key post - cold war arms treaty limiting military deployment in Europe .
Putin demands that all NATO members sign treaty .
20070714 President Vladimir Putin signed a decree halting Russia 's participation in the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) arms control treaty .
The decree stated that Russia withdrew due to certain points of the Treaty and exceptional security circumstances .
The Russian Government stated that the suspension will take effect immediately .
The Russian Foreign Ministry stated that Russia has not suspended dialogue .
NATO spokesman James Appathurai stated that Russia 's actions were retrogressive because the NATO considers the CFE Treaty to be vital to European security and stability .
Russia has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the treaty due to US military encroachment into former Soviet Union territory such as the planned missile defense shield in Europe .
In a state of the nation speech in 20070400 Putin stated that Russia should announce a moratorium on adherence to the CFE Treaty until all NATO countries have ratified the Treaty .
Putin appears to particularly target the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , former Soviet republics and current NATO members which are not part of the CFE Treaty .
The CFE Treaty limits the deployment of tanks and troops in NATO and former Eastern European Warsaw Pact countries and establishes confidence - building , transparency and cooperation measures between Member States .
The treaty was signed in Paris in 1990 and came into force in 1992 .
The treaty was adapted in Istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact in order to limit deployments on a country - by - country basis .
The CFE is considered a key European post - Cold War security accord .
NATO states have refused to ratify the new pact because Russia has failed to honor commitments made in Istanbul adaptation to withdraw forces from the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Moldova .

Saferworld Team Leader on transfer controls and small arms Roy isbister stated --
The EU embargo prohibits direct or indirect supply of military equipment for use in Myanmar .
The integrity of the arms embargo depends on its implementation and enforcement .
Amnesty International arms control researcher Helen Hughes stated that greater emphasis should be placed on end - use agreements and re - export of components from EU member states in order to avoid countries indirectly supporting blacklisted regimes which commit crimes against humanity .
Amnesty International stated --
The EU should immediately commence talks with India to prevent future sales of the alh , components or technology to India .
All future EU cooperation with India that could supply Myanmar with banned items should be discontinued .
Any future arms deals with India should prohibit the transfer of technology to Myanmar .
India does not have an arms embargo to Myanmar .

France was criticized over France 's plans to build a nuclear reactor in Libya while nuclear proliferation experts dismissed concerns .
On 070726 France was criticized over France 's plans to build a nuclear reactor in Libya .
Nuclear proliferation experts dismissed concerns that the French - Libyan nuclear reactor deal was tantamount to handing Moamer Kadhafi a nuclear bomb .
An official with France 's Atomic Energy Commission insisted that international safeguards imposed after Libya dissolved the Libyan military nuclear program would prevent any Libyan nuclear proliferation .
Other experts agreed with the with French Atomic Energy Commission official .
Sortir du nucleaire stated that the official reason for the Libyan nuclear reactor was a deception as the civilian and military uses of nuclear technology were indissociable .
The official reason for the Libyan nuclear reactor is to desalinate sea water .
Sortir du nucleaire stated that delivering civilian nuclear energy to Libya would amount to eventually helping Libya to acquire nuclear weapons .
Sortir du nucleaire stated that Libya is rich in oil and gas and Libya is very amply self - sufficient in energy .
Sortir du nucleaire stated that if Libya wishes to diversify Libyan power production than Libya should logically give priority to solar energy because Libya enjoys remarkable levels of sunshine all year long .
A memorandum on building the new nuclear reactor in Libya was signed as French president Nicolas Sarkozy held talks with Libyan leader Muammar Kadhafi on 070725 .
On 070724 the Libyan government freed 6 foreign medics after France and European Union officials had played a key role in the process of securing the release of the 6 foreign medics .
Greenpeace France stated that the French - Libyan nuclear reactor deal poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation and branded the French - Libyan nuclear reactor deal as in keeping with the French policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology .
Greenpeace pointed out that previous French Presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former Shah of Iran , with the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and with South Africa during the apartheid era .
Frederic marillier stated that the official reason the nuclear reactor is being sold to Libya is to desalinate sea water to improve Libya 's supplies of drinking water .
Frederic marillier stated that Frederic marillier wanted to know who Iran and France thought would believe this reason for building the nuclear reactor .
Frederic marillier is in charge of Greenpeace 's energy campaign .
The French opposition Socialist Party asked if it was not a bit soon to be throwing France into Kadhafi 's arms and giving him France 's international endorsement ?

Simon Nisan is a member of France 's Atomic Energy Commission and is in charge of nuclear - powered desalination projects .
The 060300 of a agreement for bilateral cooperation focuses primarily on a nuclear research centre at Tajura whose nuclear reactor was supplied by the Soviet Union in 790000 .
Tajura is near Tripoli .
Simon Nisan stated that International Atomic Energy Agency controls made it almost impossible to divert the nuclear technology to military use .
Simon Nisan stated that the International Atomic Energy Agency controls are so tight that a person does not have the right to remove fuel without the presence of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors .
Simon Nisan stated that the material generated is low - enriched uranium and not highly - enriched uranium which is needed for nuclear bombs .
In 040000 weapons - grade uranium stored at the nuclear research centre in Tajura was removed under International Atomic Energy Agency scrutiny and was sent for recycling to Russia after Muammar Kadhafi pledged to give up weapons of mass destruction in 030000 .

A diplomat in Vienna that is close with the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that the Libyan Government had had very good cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency since 030000 .

Mark Fitzpatrick is a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies .
Mark Fitzpatrick stated that Libya 's cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency , the Government of the United Kingdom and the United States Government has been exemplary .

French President Sarkozy responds to international concerns over Areva 's decision to deliver nuclear reactors to China .
Sarkozy states that French officials will be strategic partners with Chinese officials .
Nuclear company Areva of France announced on 26 November 2007 that Areva had agreed to deliver 2 third - generation nuclear reactors to China as part of a package of deals worth 8 billion euros ( 11.9 billion dollars ) .
Areva signed the reactors agreement with China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corporation ( cgnpc ) in a ceremony in Beijing attended by Sarkozy and Chinese President Hu Jintao .
The agreement was reached after months of expectations that China would buy 2 European pressurized water reactors ( EPRs ) from Areva .
The EPRS will be delivered by the end of 2013 and 2015 , respectively .
Areva also agreed to transfer third generation nuclear technology to cgnpc which would market the equipment in China through a joint venture .
On 27 November 2007 French President Nicolas Sarkozy stated to students at Beijing 's elite Tsinghua University that French and Chinese officials will create a joint venture in the nuclear field .
Sarkozy stated --
Sarkozy is not worried about technology transfer .
French officials would share advanced technologies with Chinese officials to form the basis of a win - win situation .
The French government is neither a customer nor a supplier but a strategic partner .
Sarkozy 's comments contrast concerns expressed by other foreigners that foreign technology may be taken by a potential Chinese partner and the foreign firm would then be denied any future profits .

Spain 's Director for Foreign Affairs for Europe and North America Jose Pons stated that a meeting of high - ranking officials from nations that have signed the treaty would take place on 27 November 2007 in an effort to reach a solution .
Pons stated to reporters --
The meeting must be handled with prudence because the issue is difficult .
There have been many contacts between the most concerned countries with the United States and Russia .
There have been advances but no solution .
Last week Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos stated that there was a desire among all parties including Russia to reach an agreement on the issue .
The Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty was signed on November 19 , 1990 in Paris by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) and the Warsaw Pact .
NATO and Warsaw Pact nations were the 2 opposing blocs during the Cold War .
The treaty was amended in 1999 after the collapse of the Soviet Union .

The OSCE conference will be attended by foreign ministers of the 56 member nations .
The OSCE monitors issues regarding international security and democracy .
Earlier in 2007 the Government of Russia announced it will suspend implementation of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty as of 12 December 2007 .
The Treaty is a key pact limiting the deployment of tanks , aircraft and other weapons across Europe .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated the suspension is a response to U.S. plans to establish missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic and to the deployment of U.S. and other NATO forces in former Soviet republics in Europe .
The OSCE features a rotating presidency and Spain is the current president .
Spain plans to hold a meeting outside the Conference agenda in order to reach a solution regarding Russia 's planned suspension of the treaty .
Russia and the U.S. are members of the OSCE .
Last week Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos stated that there was a desire among all parties including Russia to reach an agreement .
The 1990 treaty originally set limits on weapons for NATO and Warsaw Pact countries .
The treaty was revised in 1999 after the collapse of the Soviet Union .
To be discussed will be the role of the OSCE 's election monitoring unit following its decision earlier in November 2007 to boycott the parliamentary elections in Russia to be held on 02 December 2007 .
The OSCE 's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ( ODIHR ) defended the decision to boycott citing Russian authorities ' delays in issuing visas and unwarranted restrictions imposed on the OSCE observation mission .
On 26 November 2007 Putin stated that the OSCE had canceled its planned vote monitoring on the recommendation of the U.S. State Department and that the aim is to discredit the elections .
Russia has denied obstructing the observers and has stated the elections will conform with Russian law .
Kazakhstan 's bid to assume the rotating chairmanship of the OSCE in 2009 is expected to be a major topic of discussion at the conference .
Kazakhstan 's bid for the OSCE chairmanship is the first bid from a former Soviet Union nation .
The Government of Kazakhstan has lobbied for the chairmanship arguing it has a stable political situation , multilateral foreign policy and strong economy distinguishing it from other former Soviet countries .
Several OSCE member States have questioned Kazakhstan 's democratic credentials .
Kazakhstan is an oil - rich country .
Head of the Assessment Risks Group in Kazakhstan 's capital Almaty is Dosym Satpayev .
Satpayev stated that Kazakhstan 's chances of winning its bid for the chairmanship were considerably reduced after its last general elections were not recognized as conforming to OSCE standards .
Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev 's political party Nur Otan won all the seats in the parliamentary election held in August 2007 .
The choice of the OSCE chairmanship is made by consensus .
Opposition by 1 country would be enough to deny Kazakhstan the chairmanship .
British newspaper The Financial Times reported on 27 November 2007 that OSCE officials will offer Kazakhstan a deal organized by Spain under which the country would assume the rotating chairmanship in 2010 or 2011 .
OSCE spokeswoman Virginie coulloudon stated that such a deal is 1 scenario among 5 or 6 others .
Kazakhstan 's Foreign Ministry insists the country is still seeking the chairmanship for 2009 .

UN Office on Drugs and Crime representative Christina Oguz stated that Afghanistan has done little to stop the corruption enabling drug trade and Afghanistan 's institutions are too weak to combat drug trade .
Drug production will be a main focus of a meeting in Tokyo to assess progress in Afghanistan .
UN Office on Drugs and Crime representative Christina Oguz stated that Afghanistan has done little to stop the corruption enabling drug trade and Afghanistan 's institutions are too weak to combat drug trade .
Oguz stated to AFP in an interview that the drug industry in Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world 's illegal opium and that ending the industry in Afghanistan will take decades .
Drug production escalated in 2007 and furthers deteriorating security .
Drug production will be a main focus of ministers , donors and aid agencies meeting in Tokyo on 5 February 2008 through 6 February 2008 to assess progress in Afghanistan .
A paper prepared for the talks said the expansion of the narcotics industry represents the single greatest threat to afghanistanâ€TMs stability and is increasingly linked to insecurity and terrorist activities .
The source of the document is the website of the joint coordination and monitoring board ( jcmb ) which is a committee working to implement Afghanistan 's 5 - year reconstruction plan .
The paper said the drug trade funds terrorism , fuels corruption and undermines the rule of law that should bring security to the people of Afghanistan .
The paper said traffickers provide weapons , funding and personnel to anti - government rebels while corrupt officials offer protection of drug trade routes , poppy fields and people .
6 , Oguz stated a focus of the Tokyo talks will be the need for immediate action in lieu of talking .
Oguz stated --
The fact that President Hamid Karzai has not appointed a counternarcotics minister to replace the minister who resigned in July 2008 indicates the priority given to drug production even though Karzai has said drug production is 1 of the most important issues for Afghanistan to tackle .
Very little has been done to fight corruption .
Corruption feeds the industry in that farmers often have to pay a 10 percent tax to Afghan officials or Taliban insurgents .
Farmers must pay various bribes .
Farmers receive less than 1/4 of the 4 billion dollars that annual trade earns which is equal to more than 1/2 of the legal gross domestic product .
No one questions how people have very low salaries but drive in expensive cars and live in expensive houses .
Typically only the couriers are arrested .
Oguz stated bigger criminals are extremely difficult to find .
Some are not living in Afghanistan despite being Afghans .
Afghanistan 's opium is increasingly converted into heroin inside Afghanistan and supplies drug users in Europe , Central Asia and the Middle East .
Oguz stated blaming Afghanistan for the world 's heroin problem would be unfair as heroin production is a shared responsibility .
Chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin come primarily from the developed world and are illegally sent to Afghanistan .
Oguz stated the national strategy to deal with the drugs trade should be tailored to the different circumstances in the 34 provinces .
13 provinces were declared opium - free in 2007 which is double the figure from 2006 .
Oguz stated --
The focus should be on interdiction in southern Afghanistan because of the common interest between insurgents and drug traffickers to keep the south out of reach from the government in Kabul and the international aid community .
The north and center of Afghanistan have more order and government structure and should be offered incentives like development to persuade farmers and other players to cease opium production .
Oguz stated the necessity of a long - term effort to combat the drug problem with Afghanistan rebuilding from below - scratch .
Oguz stated the drug trade links into corruption and the insurgency and will not be an easy task to combat .
Oguz stated combating the drug trade in Thailand took 20 years even though Thailand had some functioning institutions .

The Consortium for countering the financing of terrorism launched in Singapore on 12 February 2008 and aims to inhibit militants ' access to funds in Southeast Asia .
The Association of Banks in Singapore , the Singapore Government and the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies launched the consortium in Singapore with plans for later involvement of other countries in the Asia Pacific region .
The Consortium aims to strengthen cooperation between banks , government agencies and academia to cut off funding for extremist groups .
Terrorism analyst and head of the Singapore - based International Centre for political violence and terrorism research Rohan Gunaratna stated the Consortium seeks to make the transfer of money difficult for extremist groups .
Gunaratna spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a closed - door Seminar on countering the financing of terrorism and stated militant groups including the Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah ( JI ) move between 2 and 3 million US dollars per month to fund terrorist activities in Southeast Asia .
Gunaratna stated the estimate was based on data gathered from the debriefing of captured militants , examination of documents seized from militant training camps and from intelligence reports .
Gunaratna stated groups involved in the fund transfers include the Abu Sayyaf and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front which both operate in the southern Philippines as well as the Southeast Asia - based JI and groups in southern Thailand and Indonesia .
Authorities blamed JI for bombings which killed mostly foreigners among 202 people on the Indonesian resort island of Bali in 2002 and a series of other attacks .
Gunaratna stated militant groups use the banking system , informal money transfers and couriers carrying bags filled with cash to transfer the funds .
Gunaratna stated a portion of the money is raised in Southeast Asia while some comes from the Middle East and other countries .

The Intelligence presented to the International Atomic Energy Agency Board suggested that Iran continued to work on nuclear weapons beyond the 030000 date cited in a recent United States intelligence report .
The Iranian government has dismissed the allegations in the intelligence presented to the International Atomic Energy Agency Board as baseless and the intelligence used to support the allegations as fake .
The International Atomic Energy Agency insists that the Iranian government 's simple denials of the Intelligence presented to the International Atomic Energy Agency Board are not good enough to allay Western countries suspicions .
Mohammed ElBaradei stated that Iran continues to maintain that these alleged weaponization studies are related to conventional weapons only or are fabricated and that a complete examination of the issue of the these allged weaponization studies has not commenced .
Mohammed ElBaradei stated that it was regrettable that Iran had not suspended Iran 's nuclear enrichment activities in line with United Nations Security Council resolutions and was continuing Iran 's work on more advanced uranium - enriching centrifuges .

Iran warns that new UN resolution against Iran 's nuclear program will complicate the nuclear issue .
IAEA meets in Vienna to discuss Iran issue .
20080303 deputy head of the country 's atomic energy organization Mohammad Saeedi stated --
A new UN Security Council resolution against Iran 's nuclear activities would be irrational and unlawful and complicate the standoff with Western nations rather than promoting resolution of the issue .
The path of the Security Council and any new resolution lacks legal credibility .
Supporters should be held accountable for their illegal act .
20080303 the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) board of governors met in Vienna to discuss the Iranian nuclear issue .
IAEA chief Mohammed ElBaradei demanded that Iran address allegations of involvement in covert nuclear weapons work .
Iran denies seeking atomic weapons and claims that only to endeavor to enrich uranium to lower levels to create nuclear fuel for its rapidly increasing population .
Iran demands the closing of the nuclear case because the most recent IAEA report stated that the Agency had made important progress in a 4 - year examination of Iran 's nuclear program .
Saeedi stated that reports by IAEA chief Mohammed ElBaradei presented a clear picture of Iran 's nuclear program .
The IAEA stated --
The Agency remains unable to confirm the nature of Iran 's nuclear program .
Iran continues to defy UN demands to suspend uranium enrichment .
Intelligence presented to the IAEA board the week of 20080225 suggested that Iran was involved in military research indicating non - conventional weapon development .
Iran dismissed the allegations as baseless and the intelligence used to back them as spurious .
Saeedi stated that the Iranian Government has submitted an assessment of the claimed studies and has no remaining commitments in the matter .
Diplomats stated that the IAEA board was considering tabling a resolution pressuring Iran to reveal its disputed nuclear activities .
Iranian Ambassador to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated that countries on the board should resist the potential action because there are no suitable grounds for such a resolution .
The UN Security Council planned to increase sanctions on Iran later on 20080303 in an attempt to force Tehran to suspend uranium enrichment that the West fears is aimed at producing a secret nuclear weapon .
Saeedi spoke to the official IRNA news agency in Vienna .

IAEA meeting in Vienna focuses on Iran nuclear issue and possibility of resolution supporting proposed Security Council sanctions on Iran .
20080303 the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) 's 35 member Board of Governors met in Vienna to discuss director general Mohammed ElBaradei 's latest report on Iran and the scheduled 1600 GMT UN Security Council vote on new sanctions over Iran 's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
Diplomats stated --
Depending on the outcome of the Security Council vote , the IAEA board is considering tabling a separate resolution demanding that Iran reveal its disputed nuclear activities .
The IAEA Board does not intend to undermine the primary action of the UN Security Council in New York but a resolution would emphasize the Agency 's continued interest in the Iranian nuclear issue .
The IAEA board has not made a resolution in 2 years .
US envoy to the IAEA Gregory Schulte stated to reporters prior to the meeting --
Despite limited progress in addressing past issues , troubling questions remain about Iranian activities that strongly suggest a clandestine weapons - related program .
The Board is likely to support the Security Council 's call for Iran to suspend its enrichment - related activities
Indications of weapons work constituting a violation of NPT obligations and Iran 's violation of Security Council resolutions provide strong reason for the Security Council and the IAEA to continue to investigate Iran .
ElBaradei 's latest report stated --
Iran addressed the majority of outstanding questions about its past nuclear program but refused to address allegations about its purported nuclear weapons work .
Iran is pursuing and expanding uranium enrichment in flagrant violation of UN demands .
Enriched uranium can be used to make the fissile material for an atomic bomb .
The week of 20080225 IAEA governors received detailed intelligence suggesting --
Iran was involved in military research incompatible with conventional weapon activities .
Iran continued nuclear weapons work beyond the 2003 date cited in a recent US intelligence report .
Iran has dismissed the allegations as baseless and the intelligence used to back them as spurious .

German Chancellor Angela Merkel WARNS AGAINST forming energy ties with Iran .
Switzerland signed a gas deal with Iran citing the need for Europe to diversity the continent 's oil providers .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed skepticism on Aril 29 , 2008 about countries forming energy and trading ties with Iran which could end up making the countries too dependent on Iran .
Angela Merkel made this statement after a meeting with Swiss President Pascal Couchepin .
Angela Merkel stated that the comment was not referring to Switzerland in particular .
Switzerland 's trade and diplomatic relations with the Islamic republic have been criticized in recent months after Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy - Rey traveled to Tehran in March 2008 to sign a gas deal .
Israel and the United States criticized the deal between Iran 's state gas firm and Switzerland 's elektrizitaets - Gesellschaft laufenburg .
The deal states Iran will supply 5.5 billion cubic meters or 194 trillion cubic feet of gas annually from 2011 .

On 080521 Japan passed a new law allowing the use of space programs for defense .
An official stated that on 080521 Japan passed a new law allowing the use of space programs for defense and reversed a decades - old policy amid increasing concern about military threats in the region of Japan .
Experts stated that Japan has no current plans for a new defence project in space and that the new law could make it possible for Japan to launch early - warning satellites .
The new law states that the use and development of space should be done in accordance with the pacifist spirit of the Japanese Constitution and benefit the security of Japan and the international community .
The new law attempts to remove any legal obstacles to building more advanced spy satellites and to help innovation in Japans 's space industry .
The new law comes amid growing concerns in Japan about North Korea 's ballistic missile development and China 's military and space programs .
A Japanese government upper house official stated that the Japanese government 's opposition - controlled upper house voted 221 to 14 to revise a 690000 parliamentary resolution limiting Japan 's use of space to non - military applications .
The bill proposing the new law allowing the use of space programs for defense was already approved by the lower house of Japan 's government last week .
The opposition Japanese Communist Party was against the new law and feared it would lead to a stronger military .
Japan 's Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura dismissed concerns that the new law could mean that Japan 's defence capabilities could exceed the constitutional limits .
Kyodo News reported that the top Japanese government spokesman stated in a press conference that it would be ridiculous would think that Japan would try to invade another country by using satellites and that it is impossible for Japan to invade another country by using satellites .
Proponents of the new law allowing the use of space programs for defense in Japan state that the new law is necessary because Japan has fallen behind other nations in space technology and China is attempting to capture space business in Asia , Africa and Latin America .
Japan 's US - imposed post - World War II constitution states that Japan will never again wage war .
Japanese troops have not wage war since 450000 .
Japan has one of the world 's largest defence budgets .

On 080521 Japan passed a new law allowing the use of space for Defense purposes
An official stated that on 080521 Japan passed a new law allowing the use of space for Defense purposes .
This new law reversed a decades - old policy amid increasing concern about military threats in the region of Japan .

The purpose of the new law is to remove any legal obstacles to building more advanced spy satellites and to encourage innovation in Japans 's space industry .
Experts stated that Japan has no current plans for a new defence project in space and that the new law could clear the way for the launch of early - warning satellites .
The passing of the new law comes amid growing concerns in Japan about North Korea 's ballistic missile development and China 's military and space programs .
A Japanese government upper house official stated that the Japanese government 's opposition - controlled upper house voted 221 to 14 to revise a 690000 parliamentary resolution limiting Japan 's use of space to non - military applications .
The opposition Japanese Communist Party was against the bill proposing the new law .
The Japanese Communist Party feared the new law would lead to a stronger military .
Japan 's United States - imposed post - World War II constitution states that Japan will never again wage war .
Japanese troops have not fired a shot in war since 450000 .
Japan has one of the world 's largest defence budgets .

Possibility of a global agreement to outlaw cluster bombs were given impetus as British prime minister Gordon Brown called for a total ban on the use of the weapons by the British military .
Hopes for a global agreement to outlaw cluster bombs were given a boost on 080522 when British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for a total ban on the use of the weapons by the British military .
The statement from Brown 's spokesman gave new impetus to ongoing negotiations at an international conference on cluster bombs in Dublin .
Brown 's spokesman said Brown had issued instructions to British negotiators in Dublin to work intensively to ban cluster bombs that cause unacceptable harm to civilians .
A British government spokesman said Brown had also asked the Ministry of Defence to assess the remaining munitions in use to ensure that there was no risk to civilians .
The new stance by the British government received a warm welcome from human rights activists and charities .
Head of arms control for Oxfam Anna MacDonald said Britain has at last come in from the cold .
Oxfam hopes that this strong statement from Brown will ensure that the UK signs onto the treaty and immediately gets rid of these weapons which maim and kill long after they have been dropped .
Co - Chair of the cluster munition coalition and Director of Landmine Action Simon Conway expressed gladness that Brown is following up on his previous public commitment to ban cluster bombs .
The Dublin Conference runs until May 30 and is aiming to strike a wide - ranging international agreement that would completely eradicate the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions among signatories .
The United States Government on 080521 expressed opposition to a worldwide ban on cluster bombs and called instead for technological fixes that would make them safer .
Cluster bombs were first used in World War II and open in the air and scatter smaller bombs over a wide area .
The fact that many fail to detonate on impact have made them a risk to the lives of civilians for years .
The British military currently possesses 2 Types of cluster ammunition which are the artillery - fired m85 and the m73 launched from helicopters .
Campaigners claim British troops used the m85 bombs in the Iraq war in 030000 .

Amnesty International reports on light weapons impact and urges global arms treaty preventing weapons sales to human rights violators .
20080917 in the report ' blood at the crossroads ' Amnesty International stated that a new UN global arms treaty under negotiation should require Governments to actively prevent sales of weapons likely to be used in humans rights violations .
The report stated that the system of national laws regulating arms sales is ineffective and enables Unrestrained Weapons trading leading to violations of human rights .
153 countries voted for a UN motion to introduce a global arms treaty in 20061200 and UN member states will discuss progress on the Treaty in 20081000 .
Amnesty International stated that the US -- which rejected the arms treaty motion -- China , Egypt , India , Pakistan and Russia are stalling the treaty .
Amnesty arms control manager Brian Wood stated that a minority of skeptics preferring to ignore irresponsible arms transfers defy the majority of the international community 's approval of arms control and render most national arms controls and UN arms embargoes weak and ineffective .
The report catalogues the impact of light weapons in 9 countries .
The report states that small weapons were used with catastrophic effects by the Myanmar military to disperse protestors in 20070900 and Somalian armed factions in Mogadishu .
The report also profiles Darfur , Colombia , Guatemala , Guinea and especially Iraq .
The report stated --
The US Department of Defense has funded the majority of over 1 million rifles , pistols and infantry weapons for 530000 Iraqi security personnel since 2003 .
The funding process was mismanaged and unaccountable because the contracting out of the weapons deals rendered accurate documentation of supplies and recipients by people authorizing weapons and munitions transfers virtually impossible .
The mismanagement has augmented sectarian violence in Iraq since the 2003 US - led invasion .
Researcher Helen Hughes stated that Governments must meet their obligation through an arms trade treaty with a stipulation on human rights rather than ignoring the consequences of irresponsible international arms transfers .

The leaders of Australia and Japan launched a Commission on September 26 , 2008 to press for nuclear Non Proliferation and Disarmament ahead of review of a key international atomic treaty .
The International Commission on nuclear non - proliferation and disarmament was unveiled by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and new Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly .
The Panel is led by former Australian and Japanese foreign ministers Gareth Evans and Yoriko Kawaguchi respectively and has 15 - members .
It is comprised of former heads of State , ministers , military strategists and disarmament experts .
Rudd said it will seek to shape a global consensus in the lead up to the 2010 nuclear Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) Review Conference and beyond .
Rudd said the NPT is facing increased pressure from the actions of countries such as North Korea and Iran even though NPT is the most significant and successful arms control instrument of the nuclear age and the cornerstone of global disarmament efforts .
Iran has been accused of carrying out an illegal nuclear program while North Korea has defiantly moved to restart its illicit nuclear activities after stopping them .
Aso said Japan has always undertaken a realistic and concrete approach towards realizing a nuclear weapons free world because it is the only country that experienced the bombing of a nuclear weapon .
Aso assumed the premiership this week .
Aso told the Commission to hold active discussions and prepare meaningful recommendations for a more effective non - proliferation and disarmament regime .
A statement said the implications of a likely nuclear renaissance due to climate change and energy security concerns will be a focus of the Commission .
This includes the need for renewed attention to nuclear safeguards , safety and security .
The first meeting of the Commission will be held in Sydney from October 19 to 21 .
It will be hosted by the Australian Government .
Among those in the Commission are former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland , former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo , former US Defense Secretary William Perry , ex - Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas , China 's ex - UN envoy Wang Yingfan .

Archbishop Desmond Tutu makes appeal at UN for member states to support a global arms trade treaty to stop the casualties worldwide which result from the uncontrolled small arms trade .
South Africa 's retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu on 081021 appealed to UN member states to end the casualties which result from the uncontrolled small arms trade by backing a global arms trade treaty .
Tutu 's appeal came as the UN Disarmament Committee is set to vote on an arms trade treaty ( Att ) resolution next week .
Some 85 countries are co - sponsoring the text .
Tutu pointed out in a message delivered to all 192 missions at the United Nations in New York that in the last 2 years almost 0.75 million people have died as a result of armed violence .
Tutu said each Member State can and must act to control the deadly trade in weapons that is behind these deaths .
Tutu said there can be no further delay and that is time to end the slaughter .
Tutu said there are some States which are opposed to such a treaty and will seek to undermine and delay any further progress or will seek to convince others that this Treaty is not required or cannot work .
Tutu said these States must not be allowed to succeed because the human cost is too high .
Tutu 's message was delivered by activists of the control arms campaign .
The control arms campaign is pushing for a strong treaty to stop the sales of small arms around the world and was launched 5 years ago by Amnesty International , Oxfam International and the International Action Network on Small Arms .
The UN General Assembly in 061200 overwhelmingly adopted a resolution launching a process for a treaty to prevent arms transfers that fuel conflicts and serious human rights violations around the world .
Only the United States voted against .
24 Governments abstained .
That resolution asked then - UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to seek the views of Member States on the feasibility , scope and draft parameters for a comprehensive and legally binding instrument establishing common international standards for the import , export and transfer of conventional arms .

Denmark 's foreign intelligence admitted that claims made in 2003 that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction were incorrect , yet Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen stated that weapons of mass destruction were not the reason Denmark entered the war in Iraq .
On 4 November 2008 in an address to the Danish parliamentary Defense Commission Danish Foreign Intelligence Service ( FE ) stated --
claims made in 2003 that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction were incorrect .
Fe 's work was careless .
Fe 's information was not based on credible sources .
Fe 's information sources were poor and insufficient .
Fe concluded wrongly that Iraq most likely had weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) .
The intelligence services of all other nations concluded wrongly that Iraq most likely had WMD .
It was difficult for western intelligence agencies to operate under Saddam 's regime .
few Iraqis were able to be recruited as informants under Saddam 's regime .
Iraqis recruited as spies turned out to be weak sources .
Last week Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen defended Danish involvement in the Iraq war .
Rasmussen stated --
Politicians widely believed that Saddam Hussein kept WMD and other chemical and biological weapons .
WMD were not the official reason for Denmark entering the war in Iraq .
Denmark entered the war in Iraq because Saddam refused to cooperate with United Nations .
A majority of lawmakers in the Danish Parliament approved military action .
Defense spokesman for the opposition Social Democrat Party John dyrby paulsen told Danish television that --
Rasmussen claimed Saddam Hussein did not cooperate with the UN only because he knew that the WMD argument would not be believed .

President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica called for a global reduction of military spending as a matter of international security on November 19 , 2008 .
Costa Rica is an unarmed state .
Arias in an address before the UN Security Council said the logic that leads a poor nation to spend excessive sums on its armies and not on its people is perverse and is the antithesis of human security .
It is a serious threat to international security .
Costa Rica presides over the UN Security Council this month .
Arias said Costa Rica is not a naive nation even though it has no military .
Arias is a 1987 novel Peace Prize laureate .
Arias said Costa Rica has not come for the abolition of all armies .
Costa Rica has not come to discuss reduction of world military spending which has reached 3.3 billion dollars a day .
Costa Rica proposed instead that a gradual reduction is not only possible but also imperative particularly for developing nations .
The Costa Rican President decried the limited application of article 26 of the UN Charter .
It calls on the Security Council to use international arms control to avoid diverting human and economic resources .
Arias said article 26 has been a dead letter in the vast cemetery of intentions for world peace until now .
Arias is promoting stronger multi - lateralism .
Arias said nations will continue to arm themselves at the expense of the people 's development and international security as long as the nations do not feel protected by strong regional organizations with real powers to act .
This is particularly true in the poorest countries .
Arias urged the Security Council to apply the Costa Rica consensus .
The consensus forgives debts and provides aid for developing countries that spend more on human resources than the military .
Arias pressed the international body to support the arms trade treaty .
The Treaty would control International arms sales to prevent the illicit use of weapons .
Arias said the 640 million small arms and light weapons that exist in the world has proven to be more lethal than nuclear weapons and is one of the primary threats to national and international security .
74 percent of the small arms and light weapons are owned by civilians .

Ret . Lt. - Gen. Anatoly Sokolov announced -- Soviet - built a - 135 missile defense system around Moscow is obsolete and inefficient .
He says Russia is not strong enough to modernize the existing antimissile system and should build new missile defense technologies instead .
15 April 2002 retired Russian Space Forces General Ret . Lt. - Gen. Anatoly Sokolov announced --
Soviet - built a - 135 missile defense system around Moscow is obsolete and inefficient .
The A - 135 system is the only such system in the world .
The A - 135 system should be removed .
The A - 135 system is unable to provide protection of the area or the country .
USSR deployed a - 35 anti - ballistic missile system in 1974 .
The A - 35 --
was deployed around Moscow .
consisted of radars and 64 missile interceptors .
was continually modified with independently - targeted multiple warheads .
A - 135 launched in 1994 as latest version of A - 35 .
A - 135 includes long - and medium - range missile interceptors .
The Anti - Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) Treaty allows the US and Russia to protect a single site with no more than 100 interceptors .
Russia 's missile defense system complied with the ABM Treaty .
In 1970s the US had a similar system to protect missile fields in North Dakota .
The US has destroyed this system .
The ABM Treaty bars a nationwide missile shield of the kind the US wants to deploy .
In December 2001 President George W. Bush warned Russia that the US would withdraw from the ABM Treaty in 6 months .
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated --
US withdrawal from the ABM Treaty was not a threat to Russian security .
US withdrawal from the ABM would hurt global stability .
Russian officials have said recently that the Moscow missile defense system could be upgraded in the next few years ,
Sokolov stated --
Russian government should not modernize the old missile defense system but build new missile defense technologies instead .
Modernization would be costly .
Russia is not strong enough to modernize the existing antimissile system .
Russia has lost several Soviet - built long - range radars essential for effective operation of an anti - missile system .
A new anti - missile system in Belarus would be inadequate .
Sokolov previously served as a top commander with Russia 's space forces .

Ukraine almost has all of the necessary approvals to join the European Space Agency 's program .
Ukraine is considered likely to gain the remaining approvals which will allow Ukraine to join the program and share its renowned space technologies .
The European Space Agency recommended on June 6 , 2002 that Ukraine join a multinational program that could greatly expand markets for Ukrainian space technology .
Head of the European Space Agency 's technology transfer program Pierre Brisson stated that the European Space Agency will have to ask the European Commission before confirming Ukraine can join the program .
Pierre Brisson also stated that the European Commission will most likely issue approval by August 5 , 2002 and work on the project could start on December 5 , 2002 .
The Ukrainian Government must also approve the Ukraine 's participation in the program but Deputy Director of Ukraine 's national space agency Eduard Kuznetsov stated that no problems are expected because of President Leonid Kuchma 's pro - European goals .
The European Space Agency 's endorsement followed Ukraine 's formal announcement to bid to join NATO on May 29 , 2002 .
Pierre Brisson led a team of European experts on a visit to Kiev to discuss commercial applications of Ukrainian space technology with representatives of the National Space Agency of Ukraine , scientists and business leaders .
Pierre Brisson stated that Ukraine 's materials and processing sectors are the most immediately promising to other European clients and could have a large impact on the future .
Eduard Kuznetsov stated that the space sector will outperform Ukraine 's overall integration schedules because the branch already has a record of international cooperation .
Ukraine is an impoverished former Soviet republic that gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and has since a space power .
President Leonid Kuchma 's goal for Ukraine is greater integration into Europe .
A Ukrainian company built in the Soviet era called yuzmash has helped found the Sea Launch project with the United States , Russia and Norway to launch satellites from converted sea - based oil drilling platforms .
A Ukrainian cosmonaut named loenid Kadenyuk has flown a successful mission on the U.S. space shuttle .
The European Space Agency 's program has so far transferred more than 100 technologies .
15 new companies with a turnover of 150 million euros or 140 million dollars and thousands of new jobs were created as a result .
Russia already participates in the European Space Agency 's program .

Fathers of militants killed in Kashmir vow to continue support for independence
Mohammed Aziz 's son Imam was killed in Kashmir in January 2002 .
Militants fighting against Indian rule buried the son in the Himalayan forests .
Imam was Aziz 's eldest son .
Aziz stated that he would not hesitate to sacrifice his remaining four sons for Kashmiri independence .
Aziz is angry that President Pervez Musharraf will obstruct Pakistan 's the militant Islamic groups that send fighters into the Indian - ruled portion of Kashmir .

Aziz was in Lahore near the Indian border south of Kashmir .
10000 people rallied on June 16 , 2002 in Lahore including Aziz .
Political and religious groups vowed to fight for Kashmir despite Musharraf 's promise to stop militants based in Pakistan from crossing into Indian - controlled territory to stage attacks .
Militant groups that oppose Musharraf 's crackdown and Musharraf 's support for the U.S. - led war in Afghanistan have been blamed for attacks targeting foreigners and symbols of Western influence in Pakistan .
This included a bombing outside the U.S. consulate in Karachi that killed 12 people in June 2002 .
Musharraf pledged to stop cross - border infiltration because of pressure from the United States .
The United States fears the Kashmir crisis could trigger a full - scale conflict between India and Pakistan .
The dispute over Kashmir began when India and Pakistan gained independence from Britain in 1947 .
The two countries both have nuclear weapons and have fought two wars over Kashmir .
There are increased tensions of war between India and Pakistan after an attack on an Indian army camp .
The attack killed 34 people and was one of the deadliest single assaults since 1989 .
In 1989 militants launched an insurgency in Indian - controlled Kashmir seeking independence or a merger with Islamic Pakistan .
Kashmir is India 's only Muslim - majority state .
India is dominated by Hinduism .
India accuses Islamabad of funding and training guerrillas .
The guerrillas cross the Line of Control that divides Kashmir and carry out attacks on the Indian side .
Tens of thousands of Indian troops , guerrillas and civilians have been killed .
Pakistan says it only provides moral and political support for Kashmir 's named freedom fighters .
Diplomatic intervention and Musharraf 's suppression of militants and cross - border attacks have decreased tensions of war .
There is strong resentment among Pakistan 's conservative Islamic groups .
Fighter with Hezb - ul Mujahedeen Anas Javed said that Pakistan soldiers deployed near the Kashmir border used to pray for success in Jihad but are now terrorists according to Musharra .
Hezb - ul Mujahedeen is one of the main militant groups fighting in Kashmir .
The leaders of two other outlawed Pakistani militant groups that operate in Kashmir Lashkar - e - Tayyaba and Jaish - e - Mohammed are in police custody and under house arrest respectively .
Musharraf 's crackdown has decreased tensions about war .
The dispute over Kashmir continues with no signs of abating .
A Board was created during the rally in Lahore bearing the names of militants killed during the 12 - year insurgency .
Safdar Sadiqui 's son was on it .
Sadiqui 's son was killed in Kashmir in 1993 at age 22 .
Islamic cleric Sadiqui stated that his son gave his life for Kashmir and that Sadiqui would do whatever possible to liberate Kashmir .
Sadiqui is associated with Pakistan 's main hard - line religious group Jamaat - e - Islami .
Muslim cleric Mohammed Yousaf stated his anger at the Pakistan army for preventing men from fighting against India in Kashmir at the Line of Control .
Yousaf sat beside Sadiqui .
Yousaf said that Pakistan is incomplete without Kashmir .

Cuban biotechnology pharmaceuticals program seeks to expand to overseas markets in developing countries .
The Cuban Government seeks to increase pharmaceutical profits by significantly expanding overseas markets through the development of novel pharmaceuticals and the sale of the world 's most lucrative biotechnology drug , erythropoetin ( EPO ) .
Amgen Inc. invented EPO and shares patent rights with Johnson & Johnson and Kirin Brewery in the most lucrative industrialized markets -- the US , Europe and Japan .
In 2001 EPO generated 6 billion dollars in sales for the 3 corporations .
Amgen sells EPO in the US as epogen for over 36 dollars per dose .
US epogen consumers pay over 10000 dollars each annually for the drug .
EPO is a genetically engineered protein used legally by kidney dialysis and chemotherapy patients and illegally by athletes to increase the concentration of oxygenated red blood cells .
An increasing quantity of biotechnology drugs are produced without any attempts to obtain licenses in developing nations .
US patent holders consider the trade in generic drugs a violation to their intellectual property .
Consumers in developing countries appreciate lower prices on generic drugs .
Cuba considers the generic drug trade good business and currently manufactures EPO for sale in Argentina , Brazil , India and other countries that do not acknowledge most US and European drug patents .
Cuban biotechnology executive Blanca tormo stated that Cuba carefully abides by intellectual property laws and exclusively sells EPO in countries in which no entity has exclusive patent rights .
The largest potential pharmaceutical market is in the 1.3 billion person Chinese market .
Amgen , Kirin , the small Canadian biotechnology company Dragon Pharmaceuticals Inc. and at lease 4 Chinese companies currently sell EPO in China .
The generic product costs as low as 5 dollars per dose in China .
By joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 China agreed to abide by WTO intellectual property agreements but the agreements contain mechanisms allowing developing nations to circumvent patents , particularly in pharmaceuticals , when public health concerns are deemed to override the patents .
Current state of biotechnology in Cuba --
The Cuban biotechnology industry currently generates 100 million dollars annually and reaches markets in over 40 countries .
Cuba 's genetic engineering and biotechnology center occupies modern towers approved by Fidel Castro and employs over 1000 people to engineer proteins to combat major terminal illnesses .
Cuba currently produces novel biotechnology products : hepatitis B and meningitis B vaccines , a skin growth factor , interferons , thrombosis and heart attack medicines and AIDS treatments .
Cuba has produced over 78 million doses of hepatitis B vaccine .
Cuba licensed its meningitis B vaccine to the British company GlaxoSmithKline , which hopes to eventually sell the vaccine in the United States under a Clinton - era exemption to the Cuban trade embargo .
Cuba is cooperating with the small Canadian company YM biosciences on trials of a head and neck cancer treatment .
Cuba is seeking further partnerships with foreign companies in vaccine research for AIDS , 8 types of cancer and cholera .
Cuban officials including attendees of the annual bio 2002 Industry Conference 20020600 in Toronto stated that negotiations for new biotechnology trade and production agreements were in progress with Brazil , Malaysia , Netherlands , Spain , Mexico , Venezuela , Vietnam , Ukraine , Germany and the United States .
Cuba has or is negotiating technology transfer agreements with 14 countries , chiefly developing nations including India , Algeria and South Africa .
20020500 US Undersecretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton stated that the US believes Cuba has at least a limited offensive biological warfare research and development effort and has provided dual - use biotechnology to other rogue states .
Scientists , Castro , and former US President Jimmy Carter , who visited Cuba directly after Bolton 's statement , dismissed Bolton 's statement as unfair .
Tormo stated that Bolton unintentionally increased publicity for the Cuban biotechnology program .

Russian military space forces put on test duty an optical space - object tracking facility located in the ex - Soviet republic of Tajikistan
The Russian military space forces on 020718 inaugurated an optical tracking facility that is intended to monitor objects in space and put it on test duty .
The okno optical tracking facility is near the town of Nurek in the central region of the ex - Soviet republic of Tajikistan and located 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) southeast of the Tajik capital Dushanbe .
Russian Space Forces said in a statement carried by the Interfax - military news agency that the okno ( window ) complex is capable of tracking objects 40000 kilometers ( 24800 miles ) from Earth .
The okno offers a better range and precision than standard radar facilities according to the Space Forces .
The report did not elaborate on how the okno works .
The report saids Space Forces chief Col . - Gen. Anatoly Perminov traveled to the site to report on the facility 's launch to Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov , .
According to images on the Federation of American Scientists ' web site , the facility involves telescope - like equipment housed in several large spheres .
The okno is located in Tajikistan 's mountains 2200 meters ( 7260 feet ) above sea level and takes advantage of the area 's fine weather and high transparency of the atmosphere .
Such conditions are not found elsewhere in the former Soviet Union .
The site describes it as similar to the U.S. GEODSS system , or ground - based electro - optical Deep Space Surveillance .
Three such U.S. facilities are operational .
The construction of the facility started in 790000 , but stopped after the 910000 Soviet collapse when Tajikistan slid into a 5 year civil war that undermined its economy and left its population in deep poverty .
About 25000 Russian troops and border guards are deployed in Tajikistan to help protect its volatile southern border with Afghanistan and prevent drug smuggling .

Italy is leading a technology transfer initiative developed by the G - 8 countries which will improve the technology of developing countries .
The goal of the initiative is to provide the infrastructure and good governance needed to alleviate poverty .
Italy sponsors technology transfer to developing countries as a form of foreign aid and alleviating poverty .
Premier Silvio Berlusconi supported and sponsored the initiative with counterparts at recent international gatherings including the last G - 8 Summit in Canada .
Italy persuaded partners to let Italy lead the G - 8 summit 's e-government initiative called DOT Force or digital opportunity task force .
Former IBM executive and current technology minister of Italy Lucio Stanca is leading Italy 's Internet program for developing countries as part of the Group of Eight 's efforts to reduce the digital divides .
Silvio Berlusconi gave Lucio Stanca his current role of modernizing Italy 's bureaucracy .
Lucio Stanca stated that Italy will not targeting countries that have very basic needs .
The first technology transfer projects will be implemented in the fall .
One such project is creating an electronic database for real estate in Mozambique .
So far 12 million euros or 12 million dollars have been allocated to finance the initial phase of these projects .
This cost is only a fraction of the total cost .
Italy is financing most of the cost but the World Bank and possibly some private telecommunications companies are also contributing .
Lucio Stanca stated that the world must solve the problem of world hunger , disease and education but in order to do that the world must first help create good governance .
The rationale behind creating good governance is that by making the public administration of developing countries more transparent and accountable developing countries would become more attractive potential recipients of traditional forms of aid such as loans and investments .
In effect good governance would invalidate the reason used by countries that do not do enough that donating is not appropriate because it is impossible to know whether the aid would reach its true destination .
The United Nations telecommunications agency stated that 83 countries in Africa , Asia , and the former Soviet Union still have less than 10 telephone lines for every 100 people .
Other studies note that even though the Internet has been in use for more than a decade , only about 10 percent of the world 's population has access to it .
Reducing the digital divide has taken on a central role in the fight against global poverty in recent years .
The United Nations has repeatedly stated that the world 's poor may be further marginalized if there is no improvement in access to information technology .
Reducing the digital divide was declared a priority at last year 's G - 8 Summit in Genoa which included Russia .
Italy launched pilot programs in 5 countries at a conference in Sicily sponsored by the United Nations and Italy in April , 2002 .
The Conference focused on how technologies can be used to improve administration in developing countries .
The plan for Albania is computerization of demographic surveys .
The plan for Jordan is e-procurement which will allow online trading , auctions , payment and settlement of bills .
The plan for Tunisia is the creation of electronic databases to facilitate tax collection .
The plan for Nigeria and Mozambique is the creation an electronic database for real estate .
Washington - based adviser at World Learning Ann hudock stated that poverty reduction will only occur when the poor themselves are brought into the policy process .
Oxfram America is a nonprofit development group based in Boston .
World Learning is an organization promoting education and justice .

Indian Deputy Prime Minister accuses Pakistan of becoming a haven for terrorists escaped from Afghanistan and permitting increasing guerrilla attacks in Kashmir .
20021228 Indian Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani stated at a gathering of paramilitary police officers in New Delhi --
Intelligence reports state that al-Qaeda members have fled from American forces in Afghanistan and relocated to western Pakistan and Pakistan - controlled Kashmir , making Pakistan the new epicenter of terrorism .
Cross - border incursions by Islamic guerrillas into Indian - controlled Kashmir increased in recent weeks .
The international community must beware of the situation , which could prove expensive for any country .
Pakistan 's foreign ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmad Khan stated in Islamabad --
The accusations were without merit .
Indian leaders have previously leveled baseless allegations at Pakistan .
India should resolve its issues with Pakistan including the core issue of Kashmir to ensure durable peace in the region , rather than accuse Pakistan .
India has refused talks with Pakistan .
Pakistani and American officials stated that over 400 Taliban and al-Qaeda suspects have been arrested in Pakistan .
20021228 the head of the Pakistan - based guerrilla group Hezb - ul Mujahadeen Syed Salahuddin stated at a meeting of Hezb commanders in mazzafarabad , the capital of Pakistani Kashmir , that Hezb will continue and increase jihad in the Indian state of Jammu - Kashmir with full force .
Hezb is the largest of over 12 militias battling Indian troops for Kashmir 's independence from mostly Hindu India , or its merger with Islamic Pakistan .
Advani stated --
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf 's assurance to the United States of ending cross - border terrorism in Kashmir , terminating militant camps and banning dozens of Islamic groups was merely cosmetic .
Many of the banned terrorist groups continued activity in Pakistan and Kashmir under new names .
The Indian army stated that 4 Islamic militants were killed in 2 separate gun battles 20021228 .
Indian army spokesman Lt. Col . Mukhtar Singh stated that soldiers stormed a militant hideout in Kreeri , a village 35 kilometers north of Srinagar , Jammu - Kashmir 's summer capital .

Both countries claim the entirety of the region .
The Islamic insurgency in Kashmir has lasted 13 years and killed over 61000 people .
India accuses Pakistan of funding and training the cross - border guerrillas .
Pakistan claims it offers moral rather than material support to the rebels , whom it considers freedom fighters .

A virus - like computer infection spread through Asian digital networks and disrupted Internet services in several countries .
The virus is thought to have utilized a security flaw in microsoft software .
A virus - like computer infection spread through worldwide digital networks and interrupted Internet service in parts of Asia on 25 January 2003 .
The infection slowed or halted web browsing and e-mail services in several countries .
Users and news media reported outages or slowdowns in Thailand , Japan , Malaysia , the Philippines , South Korea and India .
Internet service providers said a sudden surge in traffic jammed networks on the afternoon of 25 January 2003 .
Antivirus vendor Symantec Corp. estimated at least 22000 systems were affected worldwide .
A technical support representative for Internet Thailand stated --
A virus or worm attacked a bug in microsoft software .
While traffic among domestic Thai servers was normal , exchanges with international servers began slowing down around 12:00 pm ( 0500 GMT ) .
The exchanges came to a halt within hours before recovering the evening of 25 January 2003 .
U.S. officials stated the attack sought out vulnerable computers on the Internet using a known flaw in software from Microsoft Corp. called SQL server 2000 .
The attacking software code scanned for victim computers randomly and aggressively and sent out thousands of probes each second which overwhelmed many Internet data pipelines .
Local Thai subscribers stated that other Thai Internet service providers appeared to be unaffected .
NHK television in Japan reported --
Some of the Japan 's Internet connections experienced heavy traffic .
A public university computer had been hit by over 200000 transmissions in 1 hour .
Security firms were investigating the incident .
Traffic - directing computers at Korea Telecom freetel and SK Telecom failed to function in South Korea and affected millions of Internet users .
Chief system engineer at KT freetel Kim Chang - Rae stated excessive traffic caused 1 of KT freetel 's main domain servers to fail which forced other servers to shut down in a chain reaction .
Officials stated the system was restored after several hours but service remained slow .
The failure affected weekend Internet banking and shopping traffic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday .
Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd. is 1 of the largest Internet providers in Taiwan .
A customer service operator from Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd. stated service experienced difficulties and that some customers were n't able to access the web .

Philippine intelligence reports reveal Singapore - based al-Qaida group 's plans to bomb embassies , U.S. corporations , and warships in Singapore and to crash hijacked planes at Singapore 's National Airport .
The plans were successfully stopped in their final stages in December 2001 and 15 cell members were arrested .
Philippine intelligence reports obtained by the Associated Press reveal a Singapore - based al-Qaida group 's plans to attack embassies of the United States , Great Britain , Israel and Australia , to attack U.S. corporations and warships in Singapore and to crash a hijacked plane at the country 's international airport .
The group ordered a chemist to buy 4 tons of ammonium nitrate .
The amount is 4 times the amount of explosive that Timothy McVeigh used to bomb the Oklahoma City Federal Building .
The embassy attacks were successfully stopped in the final stages by U.S. investigators and allies in Southeast Asia but the explosives were not recovered .
1 of the phillipine reports states that Singapore is a target for terrorist attacks because of its 17000 U.S. residents and 6000 multinational companies including several American companies .
The terrorists belonged to Jemaah Islamiah designated by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization and described in 1 of the phillipine reports as part of the broader al-Qaida syndicate .
The group planned attacks in Singapore before and after the hijackings in the United States on 11 September 2001 .
The group is believed responsible for attacks throughout Southeast Asia .
The group is suspected in the bombings in Bali that killed approximately 200 people in October 2002 .
The attacks in Singapore were prevented after 15 individuals were arrested in December 2001 .
2 of the individuals arrested were released .
1 of the Philippine reports stated that local officials and Western business executives were shocked by the ability of Al-Qaida to plant operatives in such a tightly controlled society as Singapore .
The members of the 4 or 5 - man terror cells led normal lives and avoided contact with known Islamic organizations .
The members were not known to be active members of mosques in Singapore .
In efforts to avoid detection the members used code names and code numbers , communicated by e-mail , encrypted their computer diskettes and used prepaid mobile phone cards .
Investigators stated that after the U.S. military campaign began in Afghanistan members of Jemaah Islamiah planned to procure 21 tons of explosive materials and bought 4 tons of ammonium nitrate in an operation to attack embassies in Singapore .
The ammonium nitrate was purchased by captured Malaysian chemist and retired army captain Yazid Sufaat .
Authorities state that Sufaat hosted 11 September hijackers and the accused terrorism suspect Zacarias Moussaoui in Malaysia at different times in 2000 .
Authorities state that Sufaat provided Moussaoui with counterfeit documents with which to enter the United States .
Moussaoui was arrested in August 2001 in Minnesota and remains the only U.S. defendant indicted as a conspirator with the perpetrators of the 11 September attacks .
The Singaporean cell members were believed to be conducting reconnaissance when they were apprehended .
The explosive materials were sent to an Indonesian island off Singapore .
During the attack planning an Indonesian and a Kuwaiti arrived in Singapore with instructions for the embassy operations .
Cell members guided them to the U.S. embassy which was videotaped including close - up shots .
The adjoining Australian embassy was also videotaped .
In a separate plot a member of the cell took digital photographs of U.S. military aircraft and personnel using Singapore 's Paya Lebar air base .
Singapore authorities believe a cell leader traveled to Afghanistan and briefed al-Qaida leaders about the proposed shuttle bus attack between August 1999 and April 2000 .
The al-Qaida officials apparently turned down the plan because the target was not large enough .
A few days after the Singapore arrests in December 2001 a videotape was found in an abandoned house in Kabul , Afghanistan in which a narrator describes locations in Singapore where bombs could be hidden to attack Americans .
Investigators searched the homes of those detained in Singapore and found an identical videotape .
The Singapore wing of Jemaah Islamiah may also have Thai connections since at least 5 members who eluded the 2001 arrests fled to Thailand .
1 of the reports stated --
The group had previously plotted to conduct 7 simultaneous explosions in different areas of Singapore .
The Group had further planned to hijack a U.S. , British or Singaporean plane and crash it into Changi Airport in order to threaten the U.S. government to halt its military strikes against Afghanistan .
In February 2003 Indonesian police announced the arrest of the alleged head of the cell in Singapore Mas Selamat Kastari who was suspected of planning the airport attack .
Kastari also was suspected in the proposed shuttle bus attack .
The reports arose after intelligence agents from Southeast Asian countries realized after the 11 September 2001 attacks that many radical Islamic groups in the region had close connections to each other and to Osama bin Laden 's terrorist network .

The Brazilian Government is seeking to buy military technology from France that could help Brazil build a nuclear submarine .
It also wants to establish a strategic partnership with France involving exchange of experiences and knowledge and hopes to discuss deals involving France 's Rafale fighter jet and the Cougar cargo helicopter .
Brazil 's Defense Ministry said 080128 that the Brazilian Government is seeking to buy military technology from France that could help Brazil become the first country in Latin America to have a nuclear submarine .
Defense ministry spokesman Jose Ramos said Defense Minister Nelson Jobim traveled to France during 080120-080126 with the main objective of the visit being to discuss the possible purchase of a diesel - powered Scorpene class submarine that would serve as a model for the development of a nuclear submarine .
Ramos said that any defense - related agreement that may eventually be signed with the Government of France must include the transfer of technology and noted that Brazil has nuclear reactors and fuel enrichment capacity but has not had the technology to build a nuclear submarine .
Ramos declined to confirm a report published 080128 by the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper saying that the Brazilian Government would buy the submarine for US $ 600 million and pay off the amount over 20 years at an annual interest rate of 2.4 percent .
The Brazilian Government has discussed building a nuclear submarine for decades and began a formal program in 1979 .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced US $ 540 million in new funding for the program and for existing uranium enrichment efforts in 070700 .
Executive Director of Washington - based nonpartisan research group Arms Control Association Daryl Kimball said that Brazil will surely become the first country in Latin America to have a nuclear submarine if a Brazil - France agreement results in the construction of a nuclear submarine .

International Atomic Energy Agency director ElBaradei says the biggest danger facing the world is not new nuclear States but the risk of extremist groups obtaining atomic weapons .
Director General of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed ElBaradei told a conference of the world 's top defense officials on 080209 that the biggest danger facing the world is not new nuclear States but the risk of extremist groups obtaining atomic weapons .
ElBaradei urged a reduction of the world 's nuclear stockpile and better controls and said that an extremist group would use nuclear weapons upon procuring such weapons .
ElBaradei said that even countries which have nuclear weapons know that a country which uses nuclear weapons will be pulverized but that extremist groups will use nuclear weapons if possible .
ElBaradei said that countries need to be aware that extremist groups procuring nuclear weapons is the number one security threat the world is facing and added as a note of caution that given the state of the system of international controls it was hard to determine whether nuclear materials were ending up with extremist groups .
ElBaradei said much of the material that is reported stolen is never recovered and that a lot of the material recovered has never been reported stolen .
ElBaradei said in reference to Iran that the international community should quickly engage in talks with the Iranian government to secure guarantees that the Iranian nuclear program will not be used to develop weapons and that such confidence can only be built through direct negotiations .
U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman said that Iran remained the world 's top arms control challenge and that it would be a profound mistake to focus on the recent U.S. national intelligence estimate that suggested Iran no longer had a nuclear weapons program .
Lieberman pointed out that in the Nie report which said that the Iranian government 's covert work on bomb design may have been temporarily suspended in 03000 it was also and far more importantly stated that Iran 's overt work on enrichment continues apace .
German foreign minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier similarly emphasized that the Nie report in no way grants Iran any kind of absolution .
Germany has been working with the 5 permanent U.N. Security Council members on the Iranian nuclear issue .
Steinmeier consequently believes it is right for the international community to keep up the pressure on Iran .
Steinmeier said that in the interests of global safety the international community 's common goals must continue to be to prevent Iranian nuclear armament and to counteract the erosion of the Nonproliferation Treaty .

The Vienna Forum which ends on February 15 , 2008 has revealed that organ trafficking is becoming a prominent issue .
Among one of the conclusions from the Vienna Forum is that top transplant surgeons are involved in the trade .
An expert stated on February 14 , 2008 that top transplant surgeons in Austria are collaborating with criminal organ trafficking networks to target desperate people .
During the Vienna Forum to fight human trafficking Nancy scheper - Hughes stated that organ trafficking involves people from the highest levels of professions .
Nancy scheper - Hughes also stated that some surgeons are willing to collaborate with the key factors of the organ trade including criminal networks , brokers and kidney hunters .
Recently a man in India was accused of being the leader of a syndicate that is alleged to have illegally removed hundreds of kidney including some from poor laborers held at gunpoint .
Indian police stated that the man headed an illegal organ transplant ring based in the upscale New Delhi suburb of gurgao .
The syndicate may have sold up to 500 kidneys to clients who traveled to India from around the world in the past 9 years .
Nancy schepeter - Hughes stated that no accurate estimate of how many people are trafficked for organs exists but a conservative estimate would be 15000 trafficked kidneys per year .
Nancy schepeter - Hughes stated that there strong cases documenting coercion in Eastern Europe , Turkey , Israel , India and the United States .
Nancy schepeter - Hughes stated that most victims of kidney trafficking are coerced by need and not by physical force .

Individuals stuffed 10 dollar bills into the pocket of a kidney broker .
Nancy schepeter - Hughes stated that this competition is driven by desperation .
Nancy schepeter - Hughes stated that trafficking does not have to be transnational and can also be found within countries .
A December 2007 World Health Organization Bulletin included a paper that noted that the shortage of an indigenous supply of organs has led to the development of the international organ trade .
Yosuke shimazono wrote the paper .
The paper also noted that the international organ trade is not well understood because of a lack of data and lack of effort to integrate the available information .
The Vienna Forum ends on February 15 , 2008 and is being convened by the United Nations global initiative to fight human trafficking .

Colombia is worried about rebel plan involving obtaining uranium but has no evidence of plot for dirty bomb .
The Colombian government is worried about documents on the laptop of a slain rebel leader indicating the guerrillas were trying to obtain uranium .
Colombian Vice President Francisco Santos had told the 65 - member Conference on Disarmament on 080304 that the Colombian Government was alarmed because uranium is the primary basis for generating dirty weapons of mass destruction and for terrorism .
Santos backed off slightly and told the Associated Press on 080305 that Colombian authorities have no evidence or indication that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are seeking to use the uranium to build a radioactive dirty bomb .
Santos said in a telephone interview from Brussels that what Santos had meant was to take note and not take it lightly and said that putting the FARC rebels and the word uranium in the same sentence was alarming .
The FBI has an office in Bogota and Spokesman Richard kolko said in Washington that the FBI has no information or intelligence regarding the FARC attempting to use weapons of mass destruction .
The FARC has been fighting successive Colombian Governments for more than 4 decades using conventional weapons .
The document addressing uranium was found in a laptop belonging to a top FARC commander named Raul Reyes .
Reyes was killed on 080301 in a raid into Ecuador that has generated intense international criticism .
The poorly written communication addressed to Reyes was dated 080216 and was signed by Edgar Tovar .
Santos said Tovar commands a FARC front near Ecuador .
Tovar wrote that a man named Belisario in Bogota supplies Tovar with explosives and sent Tovar a catalog and specifications .
Tovar wrote that Belisario proposed to sell each kilo at US $ 2.5 million and deliver it and that Tovar and Reyes would then find a buyer .
Tovar wrote the deal would be with a Government and to sell them a sizable amount .
Tovar wrote Belisario had 50 kilos ready and could sell a lot more as Belisario had direct contact with uranium suppliers .
The uranium reference in Tovar 's writing was quickly cited by Colombia 's government while seeking to deflect criticism over the raid .
Gen. Oscar Naranjo said at an explosive news conference that the FARC mentioning negotiations for 50 kilos of uranium means that the FARC are taking big steps in the world of terrorism to become a global aggressor and were not just domestic guerrillas but transnational terrorists .
Santos took Colombia 's complaints to the European Union 's foreign affairs representative Javier Solano on 080305 .
Santos told the AP after meeting with Solano that the Europeans were really worried about the uranium and were not taking the issue lightly .
Colombian officials say they have no other information from the laptop or other sources indicating FARC interest in radioactive materials or unconventional weapons .
It was n't clear what exactly the material Tovar was writing about might be .
Santos said the uranium mentioned in the communication sounded like processed uranium .
The price mentioned suggests that the uranium would be processed and hence dangerous .
Charles Ferguson is a physicist with the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington and said that unprocessed uranium is relatively harmless and goes for about US $ 100 a kilo .
Ferguson expressed fear if the uranium in question were the highly enriched weapons - grade uranium capable of being used in a low - yield improvised nuclear device .
Ferguson was not aware of any highly enriched uranium of appreciable quantities in the region near Colombia and Venezuela .

A parliamentary commission report stated on April 9 , 2008 that money from drug trafficking in Bulgaria has been used to fund terrorist groups .
The report said Bulgarian crime groups engaged in trafficking and drugs sometimes work together with Arab citizens linked to terrorist organizations .
The Associated Press obtained a copy of the document .
The report said that part of the profit from trafficking in drugs such as amphetamines has been used to finance terrorist organizations like Hezbollah , Islamic Jihad , and Christian militias in Lebanon .
The U.S. State Department said in its 2008 international narcotics control strategy report that Bulgaria continues to be a source of drug production .
Part of that is being smuggled into Turkey and the Middle East .
The parliamentary report was issued amid revelations of illegal links between senior police officers and criminals .
The document said the amount of illegal drugs seized by authorities declined after classified police information had been leaked to criminals .
The leaks prompted the arrest of senior police and a motion of no - confidence from opposition parties .
The document is based on figures from the National Security Agency .
The motion will be voted on April 11 , 2008 .
Bulgaria 's government has been repeatedly criticized by the European Union over its inability to tackle rampant corruption and organized crime .

25 members of the Muslim Brotherhood were convicted and sentenced to jail time while 15 members were acquitted .
The charges against members of the Muslim Brotherhood included money laundering and terrorism .
A security official stated that on 15 April 2008 an Egyptian military court known for severe verdicts convicted 25 key members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood with sentences up to 10 years in jail .
The security official attended the trial at the court north of Cairo but spoke on condition of anonymity because the official is not authorized to speak to the media .
The official stated the charges against members of Egypt 's largest opposition group included money laundering and terrorism but it was not immediately clear if the 25 were found guilty of both offenses .
The official stated that 15 other defendants were acquitted .
Among the acquitted were businessman Abdel - Rahman Saudi who runs a supermarket chain in Egypt and a journalist .
Authorities created a security ring around the courthouse with 100s of policemen creating checkpoints on the road leading to the court before the verdict announcement .
Police searched vehicles and drove away reporters and family members of the defendants .
A security official stated that approximately 20 people including relatives and reporters were detained .
Defense lawyer Abdel - Moneim Abdel - Maksoud stated the judge entered the courtroom and issued the ruling but then left without notifying the opposition group 's defense lawyers who stood outside the courthouse after being prevented by policemen from entering the courtroom .
The 25 sentenced included the Brotherhood 's chief strategist Khayrat El-Shater and the Brotherhood 's prominent financier and businessman Hassan Malek .
El-Shater joined the Brotherhood in 1974 and has been jailed 4 times for a total of 7 years on charges relating to membership in the Brotherhood which was outlawed before 1958 .
Malek owns a chain of furniture stores and textile factories and is known as 1 of the Brotherhood 's main financiers .
El-Shater and Malek each received 7 - year sentences .
El-Shater and Malek 's property was confiscated and is believed to be worth millions of dollars .
Abdel - Maksoud stated the confiscation will affect the Brotherhood 's financial bases .
Abdel - Maksoud stated that a recent amendment to the Egyptian judicial system allows defendants to appeal within 60 days .
The 25 people sentenced have been in custody since December 2006 .
The arrests were believed to have been sparked by a militia - style demonstration by student Brotherhood members from the Al-Azhar University in Cairo .
The demonstrators wore black and masks similar to those of the militant Palestinian Hamas and Lebanon 's Hezbollah groups .
The demonstration prompted a government investigation into whether the Brotherhood had resurrected a military wing .
The Brotherhood figures were referred to a military court after the arrests .
The referral is authorized under emergency laws in effect since 1981 that allow the president to refer civilians to military tribunals .
Brotherhood members have since been routinely tried before military courts but the trial in 2007-2008 is the largest in years .
The verdict in the yearlong trial occurred amid a government crackdown on the Brotherhood and unrest in Egypt over rising food prices and stagnant wages .
More than 800 Brotherhood members have been detained in 2008 in an effort to decrease influence as President Hosni Mubarak enters the 27th year in power .
100s of Brotherhood members and supporters have been detained in Security sweeps since October 2006 .
The 40 senior figures on trial were detained as part of the sweeps .
7 senior figures were tried in absentia and are believed to be outside the country .
Some of the 7 's whereabouts are unknown .
5 of the absent senior figures received 10 - year prison terms including Swiss - based Egyptian - born businessman Youssef M. Nada whose company has been listed by the United States since 2001 as an organization accused of helping fund terrorism .
London - based human rights group Amnesty International called the sentences on 15 April 2008 a perversion of justice and demanded the men be released and retried in a civilian court .
Amnesty International said in a statement that the sentences leave little doubt that the Egyptian authorities are determined to undermine what has become the main opposition group in Egypt .
Amnesty International stated trying civilians before military courts flouts international standards of fair trial and is inherently unjust .
The Muslim Brotherhood 's supreme leader Mohammed Mahdi Akef denounced the verdict and stated that Egyptian authorities are corrupt gangsters .
Akef stated to the Associated Press that there was no evidence against the convicted and that acquittals for the convicted are expected .
Akef stated in a telephone interview that gangs not politicians rule Egypt .
Akef would not discuss the Brotherhood 's future plans .
The Brotherhood won 88 of parliament 's 454 seats in the 2005 elections with Brotherhood candidates running as independents .

South African government officials will not intervene to disallow Chinese arms shipment to Zimbabwe despite volatile political situation following contested presidential election .
South African officials approved transit of the arms shipment to Zimbabwe stating it cannot act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between 2 countries .
On 17 April 2008 a South African government spokesman stated that South Africa will not intervene to stop a shipment of Chinese - made weapons from reaching Zimbabwe despite the acute instability of the political situation in Zimbabwe .
South African government spokesman Themba Maseko stated that the Zimbabwean government 's failure to release election results 2 weeks after elections is cause for great concern and that the dire situation requires mediation .
Maseko 's comments were the strongest issued on the subject by the South African Government to date .
South African President Thabo Mbeki is the main mediator in Zimbabwe .
Mbeki has stated that there is no crisis in Zimbabwe despite the increasing violence and intimidation since the 29 March 2008 vote and the refusal of Zimbabwe 's election commission to release results that independent observers and the opposition State show President Robert Mugabe lost the vote .
Critics call the South African reaction appeasement .
Criticism increased on 17 April 2008 following a report that South African mediator Sydney Mufamadi led an arms control committee meeting that approved transit of a shipment of Chinese weapons across South African territory en route to Zimbabwe .
The Chinese ship called an Yue Jiang docked in Durban harbor in South Africa after receiving approval from Port authorities late on 16 April 2008 .
The Beeld newspaper stated the ship was carrying approximately 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK - 47s , approximately 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1500 rockets for rocket - propelled grenades .
The newspaper stated it obtained a copy of the ship 's cargo documentation finalized 3 days after Zimbabwe 's election on 01 April 2008 .
A South African government official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the presence of weapons on the ship but gave no further details .
Durban port authorities and police explosives inspectors could not immediately be reached for comment .
Government spokesman Maseko stated that if administrative papers are in order the Government of South Africa cannot intervene to prevent weapons from being transported through its territory to a neighboring landlocked country .
After a cabinet meeting Maseko stated to reporters --
The Government of South Africa cannot act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between 2 countries .
South Africa is not involved in the arrangement .
It would be possible but very difficult for South Africa to intervene and to disallow the shipment .
There was presently no trade embargo against Zimbabwe .
China is one of Zimbabwe 's main trade partners and allies .
A group representing mainly white South Africans called afriforum stated it would organize protests along the route to Zimbabwe .
Afriforum 's kallie kriel stated that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee had granted approval for the transit of the weapons on 14 April 2008 .
Kriel stated he had written to Committee Chairman and Local Government Minister Sydney Mufamadi asking him to retract the permission .
Kriel stated that the South African Government 's approval for the transport of the arms across South African territory effectively means that the government is replacing its ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with a more catastrophic policy of complicity with the State violence and human rights violations committed by the Zimbabwean government against its own citizens .
The South African opposition Democratic Alliance agreed with kriel 's comments .
Mufamadi also heads the South African mediating team between Zimbabwe 's ruling ZANU - PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change .
Mufamadi 's office referred reporters to the Arms Control Committee whose spokesman did not immediately return phone calls .

The South African Government stated on April 4 , 2008 that the South African Government will probably not stop the arms shipment head to Zimbabwe .
This decision is controversial because Zimbabwe is currently politically unstable .
A South African government spokesman stated on April 4 , 2008 that South Africa will not intervene to stop a shipment of Chinese - made weapons from reaching Zimbabwe even though the political situation in Zimbabwe is dire .
The shipment is in a ship called the an Yue hiang which was anchored outside Durban harbor after receiving permission late on April 16 , 2008 to dock .
The shipment contains nearly 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK - 47s , about 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1500 rockets for rocket - propelled grenades .
This report comes from the Beeld newspaper which claimed to have a copy of the ship 's cargo documentation finalized on April 1 , 2008 which was 3 days after Zimbabwe 's election .
An anonymous government official confirmed that the shipment contained weapons but gave no further details .
Durban port authorities and police explosives inspectors could not be reached for comment .
The South African Revenue Service said customs officials were bound by confidentiality rules and could not give details of the content of the cargo .
Spokesman Themba Maseko stated as long as administrative papers are in order South Africa cannot intervene to prevent weapons being transported through South African territory to Zimbabwe .
Defense Secretary January Masilela confirmed to South African radio that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee granted approval for the transit of the weapons .
January Masilela stated that if the buyer is the Zimbabwean sovereign government and the seller is the Chinese sovereign government , South Africa has nothing to do with the transaction because South Africa works according to established international conventions which allow the nation no jurisdiction over goods in transit .
Sydney Mufamadi is the government official who approved the transit and he is the same official who heads the team mediating in the Zimbabwe crisis .
Themba Maseko stated that the situation in Zimbabwe is dire because elections are held and results are not released 2 weeks after .
This was the strongest comment on Zimbabwe so far by the South African Government .
On April 17 , 2008 Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai called on South Africa and President Thabo Mbeki to step aside as mediator for Zimbabwe in favor of Zambia 's president , who has taken a tougher stance toward Mugabe .
Afriforum criticized the decision to approve the arms shipment .
Afriforum is a lobbying group representing mainly white South Africans .
Afriforum stated that the group would organize protests along the route to Zimbabwe .
Kallie kriel of afriforum stated that the South African Government 's approval for the transport of the arms across South African territory will in effect mean that the Government is replacing an ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with an even more catastrophic policy of complicity to the State violence and human rights violations committed by the Zimbabwean government against Zimbabwean citizens .
The South African Revenue Service stated that the ship would be subject to standard inspection procedures and the cargo would not be released until ithe cargo was proved to be compliant to customs formalities .
The approval process can be lengthy .
Zimbabwe is a landlocked country neighboring Zimbabwe ,

The report was due to the United Nations in 041000 .
The 080425 Security Council resolution stresses the need to enhance the coordination of national , regional and international efforts to strengthen a global response to the serious challenge of keeping weapons from terrorists and the threat to international security .
The 040400 Security Council resolution was adopted to close a loophole in global efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
International treaties targeted weapons proliferation by Governments until Resolution 1540 was adopted in 040000 there was no legal instrument to prevent terrorists , criminal scientists , black marketeers and other non - State actors from obtaining weapons of mass destruction .
Resolution 1540 was introduced as the International Atomic Energy Agency was investigating a vast black market in nuclear equipment and technology .
The black market investigation was encouraged by Pakistan 's admission in 040200 that Pakistan 's leading nuclear scientist had passed technology to Iran , Libya and North Korea .
Pakistan 's leading nuclear scientist , was Abdul Qadeer Khan .
Resolution 1540 requires all countries to adopt laws to prevent non - State actors from manufacturing , acquiring or trafficking in nuclear , biological or chemical weapons , the materials to make them , and the missiles and other systems to deliver them .

The Security Council stated that not all States have presented to the Resolution 1540 Committee the state 's national reports on implementation of Resolution 1540 and that the full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States is a long - term task that will require continuous efforts at national , regional and international levels .
The Security Council stated that full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States includes the adoption of national laws and measures to ensure implementation of the Resolution 1540 inspired national laws .
Dumisani Kumalo stated that many developing countries find the reporting requirements for Resolution 1540 and other resolutions onerous when they are trying to provide food , health care and jobs for the people of developing countries .
Dumisani Kumalo is the current Security Council president and South Africa 's United Nations ambassador .
Dumisani Kumalo stated that one of the things that South Africa is happy about is that countries must cooperate in dealing with the networks that may be spreading illict nuclear and other weapons .
The 080425 resolution was approved on the day that Mohamed ElBaradei angrily criticized Israel for bombing an alleged Syrian nuclear facility , chastised the United States for withholding information on the alleged Syrian nuclear facility , and stated that the International Atomic Energy Agency would investigate the allegations of the Syrian nuclear facility .

A leading arms expert stated that China 's improved nuclear arsenal raises questions about the Chinese government 's future arms control efforts .
The expert praised Beijing officials for decreasing sales of weapons abroad .
A leading arms expert stated on 8 May 2008 that Chinese government is making dramatic improvements to China 's nuclear arsenal which raises questions for future arms control efforts .
Director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Bates Gill spoke at a panel for journalists while on a visit to Beijing to promote an annual report on the global arms industry .
Gill stated --
Recent upgrades have increased the accuracy and mobility of China 's arsenal while a switch from liquid to solid fuel has shortened reaction times .
China stands out due to the effort to modernize , expand and improve nuclear weapons capability .
Among the 5 nuclear Powers China is making the most dramatic improvements in nuclear force which raises arms control questions .
The Chinese Government stated China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict and China 's arsenal , estimated at just over 100 nuclear - armed missiles , is the smallest of the 5 main nuclear weapon Powers .
Chinese officials signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1992 and gill stated the recent steps are aimed mainly at reducing the vulnerability of China 's deterrent force .
Gill stated that improvements in China 's conventional military are even more dramatic after more than 10 years of double - digit percentage increases in annual defense spending .
Gill stated the large increase in the military capability of China is targeted mostly at Taiwan but has the possibility going forward with force projection elsewhere .
Taiwan is a self - governing island that China claims is part of China 's territory and has threatened to invade .
Gill stated that the increase in military capability complicates the issue of China as a player in the arms control agenda and that the Chinese government would need to be engaged in future efforts to cap or reduce numbers of nuclear weapons .
Gill praised Beijing officials for decreasing sales of weapons and military technology abroad which Gill believes was largely done out of a desire to be viewed as a more responsible player in international society .
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute China has only a 2 percent share of the global arms export trade .
Gill stated that the shift in the way the Chinese government views the problem of nonproliferation is very positive .
Gill stated that authorities need to strengthen regulation to prevent weapons from entering conflict zones , particularly in Africa where Chinese arms are used by both government and rebel forces in Sudan 's Darfur region .
Retired People 's Liberation Army Colonel Teng jianqun spoke alongside Gill on the panel and stated that China has substantial restrictions on weapons sales abroad .
Teng conceded that some dealers violated the rules and were beyond the Government 's direct control .
Teng stated that further steps were being taken to boost awareness of the rules , partly through courses for government and defense industry leaders run by the foreign ministry - sponsored China Arms Control and Disarmament Association of which Teng is Deputy Secretary - General .
Teng stated a belief that the Chinese have been putting more effort into export controls .

Japan 's lower house APPROVES BILL allowing use of space programs in national defense .
The legislation is the most recent effort by Japan to ascribe more freedom to its tightly controlled military and would overturn a ban on the military use of space .
On 13 May 2008 Japan 's powerful lower house of parliament voted to allow Japan 's space programs to be utilized for national defense .
The legislation is the most recent effort by Japan to ascribe more freedom to the tightly controlled military technically known as a self - defense force .
The legislation is expected to be approved by the upper house .
The legislation is primarily aimed at permitting military use of Japan 's civilian - controlled spy satellite network for defense as defined by the pacifist constitution .
The bill states that space development has become increasingly important .
The bill states that space programs must contribute to ensure peace and safety of international society as well as the national security of Japan .
The bill does not specify how the programs will be utilized but the satellite network and other assets could potentially be used for surveillance , planning and for a missile defense shield Japan is constructing with the United States .
The bill would overturn a ban on the military use of space imposed on Japan 's nascent space program in 1969 .
The U.S. - drafted 1947 Constitution prohibits Japan from offensive warfare .
The legislation stipulates that all members of the cabinet and not just education , science and technology ministers will be responsible for Japan 's future space projects .
Inclusion of the defense minister in decisions on space programs introduces the possibility for the military to possess and develop spy satellites .
The legislation would establish a special space task force led by the Prime Minister and create the new post of space development minister .
Japan 's Defense Agency was upgraded to Ministry status in 2007 .
Japanese troops were dispatched to a combat zone for the first time since World War II in 2004 .
The mission in Iraq was strictly humanitarian .
Support .
Both the ruling coalition and the largest opposition party support the bill .
The nation 's largest newspaper Yomiuri approved of the bill and urged its quick enactment .
In a weekend editorial the newspaper Yomiuri stated that it is logical to use space development for national security and necessary to counter the threat of North Korea 's missile program .
Opposition .
Some pacifist lawmakers from the Communist and Social Democratic parties boycotted the vote on 13 May 2008 stating that the bill contradicted the principle of a civilian - controlled space program .
The left - leaning newspaper Asahi raised concerns that the legislation could escalate friction with neighboring countries .

7 NATO allies to sign agreement to create a cyber Defense Research Center in Estonia .
Experts from NATO member states will be recruited to conduct research and training on cyber warfare and will be prepared to assist allies with response to the growing threat of cyber attack .
7 NATO allies are prepared to sign a deal on 14 May 2008 to create a research center in Tallinn , Estonia to improve the NATO alliance 's defenses against cyber attacks .
Cyber attacks are considered a growing threat to military and civilian computer networks .
In 2007 Estonia experienced an unprecedented number of cyber attacks that disabled government and corporate computer networks .
The attacks occurred after a dispute between the Governments of Russia and Estonia over the relocation of a Soviet war memorial .
Many Estonians suspect the Russian government was responsible for the cyber attacks but the Government of Russia denies involvement .
Defense chiefs from Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Germany , Italy , Spain and Slovakia will sign the agreement to provide staff and funding for the center .
The United States will join the project as an observer and other NATO nations may join later .
Signing of the Agreement is a peripheral issue of the meeting of Chiefs of Defense Staff from the 26 ally countries of NATO .
The meeting is expected to focus on NATO missions in Afghanistan and Kosovo .
The generals will also discuss cooperation with Balkan and former Soviet nations including Russia and Ukraine .
The Cyber Defense Center will be operational in August 2008 with the formal opening planned for 2009 .
A staff of 30 specialists will conduct research and training on cyber warfare and will be prepared to assist NATO members with response to any future cyber attacks .
Head of the center major Raul rikk stated to the Associated Press in Tallinn --
The attacks against Estonia last year were cyber terrorism .
The mission of the center is to create new capabilities to fight new threats .
Experts will be recruited from various NATO member States and from various sectors including information technology , science , military and finance .
Estonia is 1 of Europe 's most Internet - savvy nations .
Estonia proposed creation of the center in 2003 but it was not until after the cyber attacks of 2007 that NATO leaders were convinced it was needed .

The Chinese branch of the American Chamber of Commerce recently dispatched a delegation made up of twenty - five people launching a month - long lobbying campaign in Washington directed at congress and the White House , asking them to continue to extend granting China most - favored - nation trading status .
The Chamber of Commerce delegates participating in this lobbying campaign come from many well - known in Washington , large American companies , such as Dow Jones , AT&T , IBM , Boeing , McDonald Douglas , General Electric , Westinghouse , Ford , and the Xian Ni Lei De Group , etc .
They split into five groups and altogether visited about 150 members of congress , congressional aides , and government officials , using their experience of investing in and managing enterprises in China to explain the necessity of extending giving China most - favored - nation trading status .
With the once - a - year deliberations by the American administration and congress concerning the question of China 's most - favored - nation trading status again approaching , American businesses in Washington are universally concerned that the disputes among America 's political parties in this big election year could make this question even more complicated , hence the organization of groups to carry out a lobbying campaign directed at them that is organized and is planned .
Zhen Wang , a businessman of Chinese descent who is representing the Guangzhou chapter of the American Chamber of Commerce and the Xian Ni Lei De Group and is participating in the lobbying team , said to this reporter that , as a follow - up action to this lobbying effort , he prepared to mobilize tens of thousands of distributors who belong to the company to write to their local congressional representatives to support extending China 's most - favored - nation trading status .
The head of the Guangdong branch of the American Chamber of Commerce , the attorney Yonghua Kang , said the Clinton administration had already demonstrated that it wanted to extend China 's most - favored - nation trading status and because of this , the focus of this round of lobbying was those members of congress who are more conservative .

On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of ASEAN , the heads of the nine ASEAN countries and the heads of China , Japan and South Korea held an informal meeting in Kuala Lumpur , capital of Malaysia , on the 15th .
The next day , the heads of China , Japan and South Korea held informal meetings again with the heads of the ASEAN countries separately .
This informal meeting of heads of Eastern Asian countries , the first time in history , is a good start .
After the end of the cold war , ASEAN confronted new international and regional situations and comprehensively adjusted its development strategy and foreign relations strategy , and increasingly became a cooperative organization in the southeast Asia region based on economic cooperation and integrating politics , economy and security .
ASEAN , with China , Japan and South Korea , strengthened their cooperation and jointly planned development , becoming a force that holds the balance .
Therefore , the holding of the informal meeting of heads of the countries in eastern Asia possesses important significance in promoting cooperation between all countries , in safeguarding regional and global security , and in accelerating the development towards world multi - polarization .
The development of countries can not be separated from the region , and that of the region can not be separated from the globe .
Discarding old concepts and establishing new international political and economic orders conforms with the main trend of the times in which people of all countries demand peace , request development , seek stability and promote cooperation .
To correctly understand the relationship between economic development , political stability , social harmony and national security , to diligently promote all countries , regions and the whole world to travel on the road of peaceful development , to jointly discuss east Asian economic cooperation in the 21st century and forecasting the future development of eastern Asia are subjects being discussed at this informal meeting of heads of state in eastern Asia .
Peace is a precondition to economic development .
Without a peaceful environment , any construction undertaking would be impossible to discuss .
Only when long - term peace is realized can the realization of sustained development be possible .
Therefore it is necessary to breed a new kind of security concept and to seek new methods to safeguard peace .
To establish relations between countries on the basis of the five principles , namely mutual respect of sovereignty and integrity of territory , non - aggression , non - interference in internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , is the political basis and precondition for global and regional security .

After the successful implementation of a " soft landing " , the rumbling train of China 's economy is running forward smoothly at high speed .
" Proper , quick and stable " growth will become the main theme of this year 's economic development .
Official authorities revealed that this year the Chinese government determined that the economic growth rate was 8 % and price levels will be controlled within 3 % .
This means that the whole economic operation situation will maintain a healthy pattern of " high growth and low inflation " .
People in economic circles seem to be more optimistic about the economic outlook .
The growth rate , predicted by concerned experts of the State Planning Commission , the Statistical Bureau and the China Academy of Social Sciences , is mostly 1 to 2 percentage points higher than governmental plans .
Of course , to a relatively large extent , this depends on aggregate control of using monetary policy as a primary means , or in other words , under the major premises of general tightening , how financial control should timely and reasonably conduct fine tuning .
Moreover , the impact of Southeast Asia 's financial crisis should not be underestimated .
On the part of the government , the keynote of a moderately tight macro - economic policy will not be changed .
The key of the current economy is not striving for a higher growth rate , but is adjusting structures and increasing benefits so as to make macro controls which were implemented from the second half year of 1993 obtain greater achievements and push the national economy onto a road of constant , rapid and healthy development .
Actually , as main obstacles that restrained economic growth in the past several years -- inflation and the " bottleneck " of basic industries have all been evidently relieved and the macro - economic situation tends to loosen , China 's economic development is in a relatively favorable period .
This year , China plans to create an effective pulling force to economic growth through maintaining a moderate and stable growth of investment , consumption and exports .
Fixed assets investments will grow by 10 % this year , total volumes of retail sales of social consumer products by 10 % and export growth by 8 % .
At the same time , the financial deficit will be reduced by 10 billion yuan .
After bidding farewell to the age of " the shortage economy " , relations between commodity 's supply and demand have changed from a " buyers ' market " to an integrated " sellers ' market " and competition will be intensified .
Hence , activating the consumer market , especially the wide rural market , cultivating consumer hotspots and new economic growth points appear to be particularly urgent .
Along with comprehensively implementing hardship relief measures taken towards large and medium - sized State owned enterprises , the pace of State owned enterprise reforms will be accelerated greatly , the dynamics of bankruptcies , mergers and assets restructuring will be strengthened , and enterprise deficits are estimated to decrease by 20 % and a number of competitive large and medium - sized State owned enterprises will gradually form .
However , the large amount of worker layoffs that will accompany this will cause unemployment pressure to gradually increase .
China has determined to appropriately place laid - off workers and to strive to control the unemployment rate to within 3.5 % through implementation of a large scale " re - employment " project .
According to estimates , after three years in a row of bumper harvests , if this year 's measures are effective , agriculture still has hope of achieving a good harvest .
Agriculture 's increasing production and peasants ' increasing revenues will create favorable conditions for inhibiting commodity prices and realizing the target of steady economic development .
Currently , the degree of dependence on the outside of China 's economy has reached 42 % , and the space of utilizing overseas markets and resources is in the process of expanding , but is more easily subject to the influences of the international environment .
Under the circumstances of a relative steady domestic demand , the pulling effect of the trend of foreign trade towards economic development is more striking .
Taking all factors as a whole , this year 's amount of foreign trade will be increased steadily , the import will be increased and the increasing speed of the export will be somewhat slowed down .
People in economic circles said that China should adopt positive and steady measures to solve outstanding problems in economic operations , and special attention should be given to clear up bad assets in time and strengthen financial risk prevention .
Forecasting the Year of the Tiger , although China 's economic train will have ups and downs , as long as adjusted and controlled measures are at the right time and appropriate , it is believed that the train will move steadily along the preset track .

Since reform and opening up to the outside world , China has been promoting attracting foreign investment even more as an important part of the basic national policy of opening up , the past five years have been five years when foreign merchants ' investments grew fastest , and foreign investments have stepped into the majority of fields of China 's national economy .
The amount of foreign investment actually utilized by China has been increasing in successive years , creating an historical high in 1997 , and a number of projects with particularly intensified technologies and funds have appeared .
On the other hand , since 1994 and 1995 , the number of recently approved foreign investment projects and the contract sum has been continually decreasing , which will directly affect China 's foreign investment attraction growth rate in the period to come .
Experts concerned pointed out that , after high - speed development in previous years , decelerating of the rate of China attracting foreign investment was normal .
However , at the beginning of this year , concerned parties announced that , for projects that had foreign invested , and which were in fields encouraged by China such as the new , high technology industry , infrastructure , etc. , the country would implement certain preferential taxation policies .
According to estimates , these policies would attract more foreign companies to invest in China .

Kazuo Nakamura , Director of Research at Japan 's Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank , said here today that the real growth rate of the world economy in 1998 will be about 3 % .
Kazuo Nakamura , at a public lecture jointly organized by Beijing 's Wu Jia Economic Consulting Company , Ltd. and Japan 's Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank , made a report concerning the new year 's world economic and financial situation .
After he reviewed the world economic and financial situation of '97 , he said that due to the economic growth in Asia , including Japan , further slowing down , the economic growth of America , even though its current economic activity is relatively good , and of other countries will also feel a very large effect .
Compared with the rapid growth of the past , the world economy has entered a period of adjustment .
He forecast that the real growth rate for the world economy this year would fall from the 3.9 % of '97 down to 3 % .
Nakamura thought that the rate of economic growth of Asia 's countries and regions , with Korea and Thailand being the most prominent , would slide downward to a large extent .
But , he said , for these countries the currencies already have devalued to a great degree , exports have recovered , and imports could decrease .
Because of this , he expected that their economies would slip downward to the lowest point in the next half year .
He estimated that the rate of economic growth in ASEAN would be about 4.5 percent .
Nakamura said that the Japanese economy exhibited negative growth in the year '97 , and that in '98 , if it did n't adopt good economic policies , the economy would continue to be in negative growth .
He estimated it would be negative 0.5 percent , plus or minus .
He said further that China 's economic growth would also slow in speed , feeling the effects of the economies of Japan and Asia being depressed and of the devaluation of these countries ' currencies .
But because China 's usual income and expenditures show a favorable balance , and in addition it has over 100 billion US dollars in foreign exchange reserves , it is n't likely to sink into the crisis like the other Asian nations .

The latest statistical data announced here indicates that Taiwanese merchants who invest in Tianjin achieved good operating results in 1997 .
Of the more than 420 Taiwanese - capital corporations that started operation last year , for the period from January to November , sales revenues reached 6.7 billion yuan RMB , with corporation profits of 200 million yuan RMB and exports of 150 million US dollars .
According to presentations by directors of Tianjin government 's Taiwanese Affairs Office , up to the end of 1997 , the total number of Taiwanese capital corporations Tianjin approved to establish has reached 1271 , the agreed investment value is nearly 2.285 billion US dollars , and the agreed Taiwanese capital is 1.85 billion US dollars .
This director said , in the period from 1996 to 1997 , three Tianjin Taiwanese capital corporations , namely Dingyi Foods , Fujin Carpentry , and Xinbaotianyang were listed of corporations in the selection of China 's largest 500 three - capital corporations .
Among these , the Dingxin International Company , which is famous in China for producing " Chef Kang " instant noodles , had 1997 operating revenues reaching over 5 billion RMB .
Fujin Carpentry Company , which started in the wood processing industry in Tianjin , has successively implemented graft reform of more than 20 state - owned corporations in the motherland mainland in recent years , charting a route of expanding inexpensively and developing rapidly , becoming the " Fujin phenomenon " widely commended in the economic arena .
Director of Tianjin 's Taiwanese Affair Department , Gengxin Qu said , although there was a slowing down in the growth rate of Taiwanese merchants ' investments in Tianjin due to the hindrance of Taiwanese authorities last year , resulted in only 94 recently approved Taiwanese capital corporations and the total agreed investment value reaching 250 million US dollars which were both lower than that achieved in the previous year , but the quality and technological standards of investments both have further improvements .
Currently , the average scale of Taiwanese capital corporations investing in Tianjin has already reached 25 billion US dollars , and high - tech corporations increased significantly .
This shows that the motherland 's political and economic situation has stabilized , and the investment environment has further improved and the vast market still possesses tremendous attraction for Taiwanese merchants .
He said , last year Tianjin City adopted a series of measures to improve the investment environment of Taiwanese merchants in Tianjin .
Last year , Tianjin 's People 's Standing Committee implemented checks on the implementation situation of Tianjin 's first local Taiwanese - related regulation , " Tianjin 's Methods of Implementing the People 's Republic of China Taiwanese Compatriots Investment Protection Law " , promoting the fulfillment of regulations in areas such as the rights of Taiwanese compatriots ' investing in Tianjin , enjoying preferential policies and treatment of the city 's people , and the government 's protection measures for Taiwanese - capital corporations , etc .
A Taiwanese merchant investment district has been established within Tianjin 's Economic and Technology Development District , providing conveniences for Taiwanese merchants investing in Tianjin such as more preferential conditions and more circumspect service .

According to what has been reported in the Soviet " Science and Life " magazine , biologists in Moscow have discovered that a mold element in the cells of plants can not only control the propagation of plasmodium in mosquitoes , but can also kill mosquitoes .
This method will not pollute the environment .
Biologists mixed a mold element in the cells of plants with pearl powder to produce a granulated drug .
This kind of drug can slowly discharge the mold element from the cells of plants in water .
When mosquitoes feed , they suck the mold element from the cells of plants into their bodies .
Experiments have shown that adopting this method can reduce the chances of mosquitoes transmitting malaria down to 1/70th to 1/80th of the original ratio .

Today , the " Jerusalem Post " quoted the words of Shawel , director of the Administrative Office of the Israeli Foreign Ministry who is now visiting the US as saying that the World Bank has decided to provide 250 million US dollars of aid to Palestinian Autonomous Authorities before the end of 1994 .
This decision broke the impasse between donor countries and Palestinian Autonomous Authorities that had lasted for nearly one year .
At the international meeting on aiding Palestinian autonomy which was held in Washington on October 1st of last year , donor countries pledged to provide 2.4 billion US dollars of development aid within 5 years , of which 750 million US dollars would be appropriated in the first year .
But donor countries claimed that the Palestinian autonomous region lacks necessary mechanisms for handling the aid and accounting items and therefore refused to completely fulfill this promise .
Shawel said that although the US and the World Bank are currently not completely satisfied with Palestinian accounting work , they have still agreed to pay a portion of the funds as soon as possible .
Arafat , chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestinian Liberation Organization , and other Palestinian leaders have been criticizing the donor countries for not being able to keep their promise to make sure the money aid is completely in place and on time .
It is predicted that Shashe , the PLO 's chief negotiations representative , and Rosechird , Israel 's chief negotiations representative , will go to Washington to specifically negotiate and determine the aid issues with the US and the World Bank .

Premier Peng Li delivered a written speech to welcome the International Population and Development Congress .
He thinks that the Chinese government 's guidelines of planning , strategizing and implementation of the population problem and socioeconomic problems as one is correct , effective in its implementation , and successful .
Peng Li said that in the beginning of September of this year , the United Nations would hold the International Population and Development Congress in Cairo with the theme of " population , continuous economic growth and continuous development " .
This shows that the international community has increasingly recognized that population and development are inseparable , and prepare to adopt actions together .
He feels that this Congress has important meaning , and the Chinese government has given it high level attention and will be sending a delegation to attend the Congress .
Peng Li said China was the most populous developing country in the world .
The Chinese government included the population problem into the overall planning of the national economy and its social development , always emphasizing that population growth and economic development need to fit together , and be coordinated with resource utilization and environmental protection .
In light of China 's basic national condition , the Chinese government has determined planned parenthood and environmental protection as two basic national policies , implementing a population policy and planned parenthood program that suits China 's actual needs .
At the same time , the Chinese government also formulated a series of important policies and measures to realize continuous development , such as the protection of women 's legal rights and benefits , the promotion of equality among men and women , the forceful development of healthcare for women and children , the zealous elimination of poverty , and protecting the environment .
Presently , the Chinese economy is continuously growing , society is stable and united , people 's livelihood are continuously improving , and the population birth rate and the natural population growth rate has dropped to a lower level .
Peng Li said the population problem was one of the major problems currently faced by the international community .
Due to differences in country 's situations , differences in economic development levels , cultural backgrounds , historical traditions , and social systems , each country should formulate suitable , effective population policies according to the actual situation of the native country .
This is the sovereignty of each country and it should receive full respect .
He said China was in a critical period of building up a socialist market economy system and increasing the pace of its modernization build - up , but a huge , overwhelming growth in population was still restraining the social and economic development , affecting the further improvement of the living standard of the people , and has also brought about heavy pressure on the natural resources and the natural environment .
Because of this , for a fairly long period of time , at the same time as forcefully developing the economy , China will continue to pay close attention to doing well the work of family planning .
The Chinese government strongly believes that , the resolution of China 's population problem is not just being responsible for the prosperity of the Chinese race and the happiness of future generations , but is also an important contribution in stabilizing the world 's population .
For this , the Chinese government views with extreme importance and actively participates in international population activities , and sincerely hopes that the international community will adopt a stand of realistic resolution of population and development problems , seeking similarities while accommodating differences , co - operating closely to strive hard together towards a stable world population to create a beautiful future !
